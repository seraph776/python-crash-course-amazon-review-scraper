Luis Garcia,5.0,Hand down best Python book for beginners!,January,"This book gave me functional Python3 knowledge after about a month of studying and following along. I’ve not yet finished the projects but look forward to doing so. The author is great at explaining concepts and does it in a very well thought out order. The practice problems are just independent enough to be challenging and it does not at all feel like your hand is being held the whole time. Be advised, there is a 3rd edition of this book out now. Not much of a difference but this is not the latest edition anymore."
michael niosi,5.0,"Amazing book, but I didnt know the 3rd edition was just released...",January,"I only finished the first section so far, but I love this book enough to leave a five star review. It explains all concepts simply, but with just enough details to not overload you. Hope im not missing out on much by purchasing the 2nd edition and not the 3rd."
bri,5.0,Great Book!,January,"I have already done some learning on python through some online courses, and this book is an amazing supplement that even went into better detail then my online class! Can’t recommend it enough. This book will really help you. It is very easy and simple to follow."
D. Siddall,5.0,Best Python Intro Ever,January,"I’ve approached python several times, with varying levels of commitment. This is the first text I’ve encountered that threads the needle between being comprehensive and approachable. I’ve been completely absorbed for over a week, and am getting excited about testing out what I’ve learned with some more advanced books in the No Starch series. Highly recommended!"
sri,5.0,Good book for the beginners,January,"I like the simplicity of the text and explanation of the author to understand easily. The other free sources like pdf, cheat sheet and much more resources which were provided in the website are very useful."
G. W.,5.0,"Recommend getting, but also get proof of Python knowledge elsewhere (see below)",December,"So far I've only made it to ""for loops"" chapter 4; but I think this is a really good book. I had an online class from a local University and this book has covered somethings that the class did not. Not that what the book covered and the class didn't has been major; but is interesting that only having reached chapter 4 in the book that there are things the class left out. So far the biggest change between this book and the class I took is that the book does a much better job of explaining for loops. I even watched a video on Youtube to teach you Python with no experience and even that did not do as good a job of explaining why a for loop is written the way it is. Being that the class I took was online and was one of those classes done in half the time (warp speed) I didn't bother to ask why a for loop is written the way it is I just wrote it and followed the class examples (and yes I passed the class with an A but Python is not my first programming language). I feel way more confident in learning Python after the book did such a good job of explaining for loops that as I continue with the book I believe it will explain things better then the class I took or the video I watched. On a side note the class I took, as all college classes I have taken do, required a book and that book just didn't do a good job of explaining for loops (go figure). You might be wondering why am I using this book if I took an online class and the answer is it has been awhile since I took that class so I need a refresher. Also the college that I took that class from doesn't offer another a following Python class to take unless you sign up for a degree program (and I already have a degree I just want to become proficient in Python). I would recommend that if you want to learn Python to use in a job to take at least one class from a college or another way to get proof that you learned Python other than studying it on your own. Also another reason to learn from a book with no class attached to it is you can learn at your own pace. Now I could learn from the book that I bought for the college course since the class only went so far into the book; but I just didn't find that book to be very well written and full of information one doesn't really need to learn how to program with Python. I feel like a ""college"" course book has a lot of bloat while a book like this one is more straight forward. A book like this one survives and sells or not because it is good etc while a college course book is chosen by the teacher or school regardless of the reviews it got. So after this extremely long review I would recommend this book; but I think one does need something (a class, certificate etc) to show proof that one has at least some Python knowledge outside of ones own studying."
Diana,5.0,Buy it! Thank you PCC!,October,"Bought this book (actual paper copy and no I didn't have any issues with the binding) in July to prepare for an intro to python course for school that started in Aug. I got through the book in about 6 weeks (balancing work and personal life) and it is totally do-able. This book prepared me for the basics that were covered in class and allowed me to think outside the box when it came to discussions. The book truly gave me the confidence that I believe I would have not had otherwise. You do not need to know any fancy terminology or have ANY idea on how to create a programming environment. The book guides you through the entire process (creating a programming environment, downloading packages, etc)  and you can find the solutions to the problems online, the author gives you the URL to the github site so you can check your work. There is an online Python subreddit that the author checks and will respond to your PCC questions as well."
Paul,5.0,Excellent book,December,"I learned a lot about python from this book. The author clearly explained each topic, followed by real-life examples."
Jason Zheng,5.0,Amazing Beginner friendly introduction to Python,December,Terrific start in learning python. Many concepts are easy to understand with no need of previous knowlege needed. Only knock on it is that some explanations didn’t go into too much detail so I had to search it up on google to understand. Other than that great book!
Amazon Customer,4.0,Thank you,December,I like it thx
Duey2000,5.0,Great book!,November,I got this book to compliment a class that I was taking and it was a great companion. It’s easy to follow for somebody with little to zero coding experience and it offers easy to follow exercises along the way to help you catch on to the fundamentals. I would recommend this to anybody starting out in Python. I plan on getting more from the series.
James,5.0,"Great book, easy to learn",December,I really like this book and it's nice vs learning everything through online tutorials.
LoveyDovey,5.0,I have to give you your five stars,November,I am as beginner level as you can be and this book has propelled me in my Python journey.
Chris Paschen,4.0,"Great, but don't try to CRAM the Crash Course",July,This book was great. We used it for a 1 semester intro to programming course with high school students.
Zerono,5.0,Tips for beginners,February,"Wanted to add in a few tips, so beginners don't get discouraged. Just started reading this book yesterday, and immediately I ran into an issue with getting Sublime Text to work properly. If you're having the same problem, here's what's going wrong. On page 9, the author mentions that you can skip the part that says to create a ""New Build System"" if Python 3 is running correctly. If you were like me and you did not skip that part, then you might run into some issues. When you get to ""print(""Hello Python world!"")"" and go into Tools/Build System, choose ""Python,"" DO NOT choose ""Python3."" By creating a ""Python3.sublime-build"" you are creating an extra, and unnecessary, choice under ""Build System."" Also, the program will not run if you choose ""Python3"" that you've created. So skip the part that says to create ""Python3.sublime-build."""
Owen C. Marshall,5.0,"Easy to Follow, Good Intro for Self Learner",May,"With the lockdown from the global pandemic, I have been forced to work from home like many other people. Since my usual job involved supporting hardware, this meant I was going to be stuck! Fortunately, my boss said that if I could spend my time learning skills useful to the lab, I could count the hours doing that. I asked whether learning Python would count. I told him that I would try to create scripts to monitor my hardware from home. He said that was acceptable."
Michael Baudendisel,4.0,"Fantastic Resource For Beginners - Skip the Youtube Videos, Start With This",May,"I tried learning Python using youtube videos but was unable to find a class that did a good job of explaining the basics for absolute beginners. Decided to give this book a shot and it was a night and day difference. I think those videos would be a good follow up AFTER I finish this book, but this is the perfect place to start."
Rohit kumar,5.0,Excellent,November,Excellent product. No complaints. Even able to hold my Moto G Plus.
KC,4.0,Very good book but not for me,August,"I think this book is a decent read for those who are starting out as programmers and this is their first language. But for someone like me who has taken a few programming courses, I did not enjoy it as it is a lengthy read. I would have been fine with doing a quick online course. I think I would have preferred, ""Automate the Boring Stuff With Python,"" rather than this one."
Johnston,4.0,More Information than Expected,April,"First: This book has a LOT of Information. The format is broken down in a way that makes it easy as a newbie gettig into Python. It covers more things than I originally anticipated. It's one of the few books(6) I originally purchased when getting into the Python Language. It also remains my favorite in starting out. For some reason a lot of ""beginner's"" books about SQL, C++, Python Ect seem to either assume you somehow already know how to code or project the feeling your 4yrs old. This book is NOT that. It's a prefect balance imo and even though I now have moved on, I still find myself referring back to it every once in a while. Starts out with how to install, how to code, make your own game within Python more. Best book I've bought that got me into learning  hands down."
N8,5.0,Very detailed and clearly explained,March,"I've had some programming experience in the past.  I've written very basic Perl and Python programs in the past, and have a solid understanding of the basics, such as strings, variables, functions, statements, etc."
Crafter,5.0,I consider the best book for learning Python.,October,Clear explanations.  Excellent TOC and Index.  Go to more specialized books for GUI interfaces or panda.
Scott,5.0,"Excellent book, easy to understand",October,I used this to learn Python and I had great success. Sometimes you need to search online to expand your knowledge about a specific topic but overall a great well written book.
Julz,5.0,Great introductory programming book in python,July,"This is a great introductory programming book that starts with the basics and teaches about variables, lists, dictionaries, classes, and many other topics. The author explains each concept thoroughly which makes it very easy to understand. After introducing a concept, the book has exercises that test your understanding to ensure that you fully understand the content. Unlike some other books, the author provides solutions to all the exercises on his website. After teaching the basics, you work through a game, data visualization, and designing a website. In essence, this is a great and affordable book for those with little to no experience to learn how to program in python."
Some Guy,5.0,Great,January,"This is probably one of the best introductory programming books I've ever tried. Back when I was an undergraduate, I learned Pascal (yup, they still taught it at that point), C, and C++.  Neither the professors or the textbooks were very good at explaining...well...anything. Luckily, I was able to figure things out for myself, but it really left a sour taste in my mouth about programming (I've done scripting professionally, but it wasn't my primary role)."
JKX,4.0,"As press company called ""no starch"", sure enough, there is not enough glue/starch serve as binder.",June,Just used a paper clip dumped some glue between center of the book and cover. It should fix the problem.
Ryan,5.0,Thorough and easy to absorb,August,"For context: I'm a web developer and programmer with ~15 years of experience reading this book to get up-to-speed on Python. So my brain might be filling in some things that other people miss. However this book seems very straightforward and easy-to-read with lots of examples and written descriptions which explain what the code does and why. I'm about halfway through so far, and covering topics that I'm familiar with in other languages."
James Brumley,5.0,Looks good,September,I haven't had time to sit down with this book other than a precursory glance through the chapters. Looks to be a decent reference and textbook.
pgmr,5.0,"Excellent organization, explanations, exercises",August,"I have read about 150 pages so far and am very pleased with ""Python Crash Course"".  Organization is great in that subjects are introduced in a logical order.  Instructions are clear and explanations are concise.  The exercises are peppered throughout and allow you to practice what you've just read.  At first I thought they were too repetitive but soon realized repetition is advantageous to imprinting new procedures on my brain."
Amazon Customer,5.0,Good,October,Brand new
WF,5.0,I have a whole bookshelf on Python books. Hands down the best book for beginners!,August,"First, I just want to say thank you for allowing multiple chapters in your free kindle preview! I get so frustrated when I go to buy a new score (music) book. Just this week I purchased a Halloween easy piano book. It only shows the cover and the index. Now one is going to steal any music if you show two or three pages of different scores. But, it lets me know if I've at the level to be able to play it. Which brings me to this book. I have many beginner Python books. I wanted to teach a friend python and couldn't really recommend a book. On Kindle, I saw this had a free preview. If it didn't I wouldn't have purchased this book. But, it had I think four free chapters. I read chapters two and three. And was hooked. Now...I am compltely paperless. I do everything by PDF. However, I'm a book person. I like having a physical book. I've tried e-books but it's just not the same. I ordered the paper book and while it was shipped I was able to keep reading thanks to the free preview."
Curtis May,5.0,Great book and very intuitive.,September,"This book opens the door for many to learn and understand Python programing.  I am a self-taught basic, C, and a few other programming languages and now Python.  Love it."
geekandglitter,5.0,Can be used both as a reference and a teaching tool,December,I am a beginner/intermediate Python programmer with many holes in my knowledge; thus I am using this book both for reference and for systematic self-teaching.
William Conway,4.0,Get a new IDE/compiler,April,"OK . . . .there are more than 4,000 reviews on this book, but I wanted to put my 2 cents in. The book is awesome and I'm only two chapters in . . .but seriously!!!!!! The Sublime Text editor the book has us downloading is weak. Now, you might have to register and pay for the service . . . .My copy said UNREGISTERED in bold letters at the top . . . .I'm not paying money for that thing and realized there are so many text editors/compilers you can get . . . I went out and used programiz.com. Now, you have to place code in your web browser. . . . and I'm not sure how objects will be affected . . . .but I was so relieved to find that all my source code worked!!!! The url is programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler . I feel great and the book is wonderful . . . .but that sublime text editor has to go . . . .I downloaded Code::Blocks for my c++ coding . . .and that thing was a beast . . .tons of information and the compiler looks solid . . . .but this sublime bull text editor is so measly . . .I have no idea how 4,000 people survived without freaking out the way I did . . . .so, if you're living in 2021 using Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes . . . .you might need a better compiler . . .I'm just saying . . . ."
John,4.0,Changing the rate,November,This book does all it can to make programming formidable and boring. It's not concise. It's too wordy.
Marvin,5.0,Very good intro to python!,September,The programming concepts are very clear. Which are illustrated with good examples.
Dan,4.0,Great inner content! Not that great outer quality. Still worth it!,July,"Have had this for one day and the cover is already coming off. Nothing a little glue won’t fix, and that’s the downside of paperbacks that you have to put weight on to keep closed, in my opinion."
idontwanttomakeone,4.0,"Binding does pop off. Definitely for people with zero code experience, but still a great reference.",May,"My background is in JS, so I was looking for something that would both help me navigate installing Python3, learning the language syntax and differences in rules, and delve a little deeper in classes & objects."
JohnP,5.0,Great resource,July,Layout is great and I really liked the online helps .
Bill,5.0,Great book,April,"This book is great! It immediately has you working in Python and each exercise builds from the last one. This book is so far has easily taught basic concepts of coding in general. The only thing I would suggest is to introduce commenting right after the Hello World exercise, I was already familiar with commenting so I added them as I did the exercises. So that's really my only bit it criticism so far with this book."
Jenna,5.0,Learning the Basics Quickly,April,Everything was well thought out and explained.
Noah Benedict,5.0,An Excellent Introduction,November,"i have a very hard time with reading and comprehension. most text books or educational materials are super hard for me to read due to various disabilities. i have wanted to learn how to program for a very long time, but i was intimidated by most texts and felt discouraged that someone with these issues could never learn to program"
D. Smith,4.0,Kindle Version Code Examples Issues,April,I have the kindle version and I do like the content.  One complaint I have is with the code examples...the pictures I have included are from chapter 7.  A snippet of the book and a screen shot of my computer... The example code can be convoluted at times (tabs and spacing) and  if not done correctly the program won't work as expected.
Amazon Customer,5.0,this book!,August,all you need is this book and a computer and you will be on your way to learning Python code. it’s up to date AND totally worth the investment considering what Python code can earn you.
Patrick Hoang,4.0,Great start for Beginners in Programming and Python! But Needs Better Practice Problems.,October,"It took me some time to get around to learn Python scripting, but so far it is simple and straight forward in how to program in Python.  If you want to get in further depth, it would definitely be good to check out O'Reillys books for Python as they are more in depth technically(have not used it, but my coworker has told me so)."
Amazon Customer,5.0,Excellent Introductory Book,June,"This book is excellent for anyone who wants to learn a computer language from the ground up.  It walks you through the free software to install (how to install it and trouble shoot any issues you may have), gives plenty of examples and discusses common errors, and has made learning Python easy and fun."
Marcos,5.0,Exactly what I was looking for! [UPDATED],October,"I am 8 chapters in and so far all my expectations have been exceeded. The book is very well organized and assumes the reader is starting from virtually zero programming experience. If you've got an analytical mind and love solving problems, you'll be okay. I have a lot of experience in Excel where some of the longer formulas indeed feel like mini-programs, so certain things in coding like variables, Boolean expressions (True/False) were already familiar."
M.M,5.0,Python is easy to learn with this book,May,"I purchased this book and quickly dived into it.  I am on halfway into chapter 5 and am surprised at how fun it is to learn Python.  The explanation to code and how it works is easy to understand.  I like the mini Try It Yourself within the chapter or towards the end, where you get to try out what you learned.  If you get stuck, a simple Google search will help you further expand your knowledge.  I am enjoying learning Python at my own pace.  I needed it this for work and it is helping tons!  If you are looking for a new program to learn or just want to advance your knowledge, pick up this book.  I am also teaching my 10-year old daughter how to program in Python.  She understood the concepts and explanations well enough to do what the book says on her own.  This book is not hard.  Dedicate 1 hour a day and YouTube or Google some issues if you get stuck."
Giordano Bruno,5.0,Good introduction to Python,June,"Well explained Python basics. I am half through the book and loving it. I hated Python before this book arrived to my book shelf, so I changed my mind on it and started over. I have some previous Java experience, can guarantee you that Python is much easier."
Ray Elkins,5.0,Everything I was Looking For,September,"I’ve tried to learn Python off and on for the last 4 years. Each time I was discouraged by the content I was using to learn. Everyone seems to want to teach Python like it’s Algebra. I hated Algebra and never got higher than a ‘C’ in it. Because my new role can really make use of learning a programming language, I thought what the hell. I bought this book expecting it to be collecting dust by chapter 2. I was wrong. I have covered 1.5 chapters each week for the last 7 weeks. It is quite evident that the author is a teacher because he understands that well thought out examples make a difference. No Algebraic expressions here…just really fun, real world examples to work on. I have confidently went from zero to hero. This book, if used appropriately, can take you to a comfortable intermediate level (250-300 level). I’m now teaching fundamentals to new learners."
Felipe Marin,5.0,Good for begginers!,September,Easy to understand and it has great projects!
Carlos Hernandez,5.0,Can’t wait to start learning Python,August,"Heard a lot of good things about this book, finally decided to buy it! Came fast and I’m great condition."
michael bouley,3.0,i got them,October,works good
DJ,4.0,"Not very detail oriented, but enough to get someone started with Python",March,"I was disappointed in that it didn't have a lot of details.  It certainly is not a reference guide or detailed - how-to book, but enough to get someone started with Python.  After using the book one can just google more about the language to learn more."
Tim O,5.0,Great resource to start Python,May,"I love this book. My fourth No Starch Press book and like the others, clear, concise, engaging and informative.  Author Eric Matthes does a fine job of gently but effectively leading a newbie into the world of programming.  I must also confess to loving the artwork and book design that marks a No Starch Press book.  Thank You."
Voyager,5.0,Great way to start learning Python.,April,"I’m new at this - never studied computer science, never programmed anything in my life. This book is set up for the true beginner like me. I’m halfway through it and have been able to understand all the concepts so far, and I’m able to make basic programs. Python seems to be a popular programming language globally, so I’m glad to be able to start learning it on my own. Very pleased so far."
Ian Knott,5.0,Get it!,May,"It will guide you well, and you will learn. I am almost done with the book, and it has exceeded my expectations. If you are a person who learns better with a physical object, I would recommend buying books for your learning process. I have been doing Codecademy pro, udemy, and many other online tools, but this one is it I can now write my own code without using the internet to figure it out. It isn't just a guide on how to build something (though it does have that) it teaches you the syntax and proper format. Make sure you do every programming example and read through each of them to better understand. Also, try all the project ideas they have inside. If this book doesn't work for you attend a community college course on intro to programming or something. But I am sure you will get it once you read this book!"
Leeber Cohen,5.0,"Wonderful tool. Not enough math and physics,",November,"There are numerous positive reviews of this text as a excellent learning tool for Python. The code for the longer excercises can all be downloaded from the  publisher's website. This is particularly wonderful for the long projects particularly the Space Alien Game. If you are interested in math and statistics you will need to supplement this text with other publications. Math Adventures with Python and Doing Math with Python  from the same publisher were fun. However, the math is at pretty at high school level.  The Math Adventures with Python uses Processing graphics software which  several reviewers were not happy with. I hope to explore other publications and review them as I go. I would mention that I a am using Anaconda with Python 3.8 for the crash course. Matplotlib and several over libraries  are easily called without any  Path issues. Python Crash Course is a wonderful text and the author strongly deserves our thanks for the dedication and preparation involved."
Dilipkumar Nair,5.0,Very good book.,August,This is a really very good book.
Amazon Customer,4.0,"Written with the best of intentions, but falls a bit short",September,"For a start, the cover falls off. That seems to have happened to other readers.  At least it makes it easier to keep the book open at the page you are reading while using your other two hands on the computer keyboard. The instructions on how to complete the installation of Python and Sublime Text so they would work together was not clear enough for me – I had to get help before I could make anything work. But then, progress through the chapters seems slow, especially if you are going to do all the exercises: The explanations are clear enough but I kept on wanting to look ahead to find out how to do something the book hadn't got to yet, and this is where I found the most frustrating inadequacy: the index is not helpful enough. If you want to find out how to copy a list to a file, for example, you won't find  any reference to that in the index.  Searching the internet is much more productive. Perhaps I was looking for a reference book rather than  ""crash course"". I needed the book but it didn't work as a crash course for me. It might for somebody with more patience."
Louis Tyson,5.0,One of the Best DIY Software Development Books I've Encountered so far!!,February,"I like the way Eric laid out his material and examples in such a way that each one formed a chain of the whole. Moreover, he not gave great examples, he took the time to give more of the like along with a detailed explanation of that example.  Again, each example flowed smoothly into the next as well as into the next subject and chapter."
Alex D.,5.0,Learned a lot very quickly,April,This book has made it easy for me to get a basic understanding of Python coding in such a short time. The explanations of how and why certain codes are doing what they do are very easy to understand. I ordered a second book from them and can't wait to crack into it and have already added more books from them to my cart.
Ivan Figueroa,3.0,Disappointed,July,"The book was perfect up until where you start making your own projects. I had been following along perfectly and learning a lot, and that made me very excited, however I am currently in the middle of the Alien invasion project and it's horrible. The author uses Pygame but does not explain any of the mechanisms of behind it at all and it sucks when you're copying code from a book that would not be able to replicate by yourself."
Mike Trumpfheller,4.0,Cover and content,September,Cover:
A. Viz,5.0,Great for beginners!,December,"I've tried many different methods to learn Python, but nothing really stuck. I took a course in grad school specific to ArcGIS, but wanted to get a basic understanding before trying to apply to ArcPy once again."
Cici,5.0,Great book for beginners,April,"After buying several python book and taking several online tutorials that didn't work for me, I found this book. This book goes step by step into python concepts with examples and exercises. The answers are available online in case you need it."
Kay,5.0,Learning a lot with this book!!! (beginner),February,"I love this book. I am a beginner, and I have been trying to study and finding ways to keep all the"
JJH Colorado,5.0,Best software language tutorial I've used in decades,May,"I don't write a lot of five star reviews, but now that I'm half way though this book it's time to give this one a top rating.  A developer by trade, I'm coming out of retirement and learning python.  This book is like a good college text book.  Written so that someone with little programming knowledge can learn the language and learn it well, it's also good for development veterans who want a solid foundation with python.  If you approach this like a tutorial and you read through it and do the examples (and add in your own), you'll have a pretty good grasp on the language.  Of course there's room for advanced topics when you are done.  A five star review from me for this book."
Samson,3.0,Overall Pleased,December,"The first 8 chapters are presented at a good pace with lots of exercises.  (Work the exercises).  Exercises are challenging the first time you see them.  Ch 9 (Classes) didn't stick the first time through, but maybe it's the material ??  I expect to have to repeat it several times."
Amazon Customer,5.0,This is a GREAT book!,June,"I read this book after taking an introductory online course. The online course did a great job of helping me understand the core concepts of Python, but left out a lot of the conventions (such as formatting). This is where the book REALLY comes in handy. The author puts an emphasis on common formatting used within the industry."
Brian Gorman,5.0,THE BEST book for learning Python,March,"I am a total beginner to programming. In my quest to learn Python, I tried parts of some video courses, and even the Head First Python book. They were all good, HFP being the best of the group. But this book, in my opinion, is perfect. This is a lifelong programmer taking you through a perfectly logical learning course, laying a foundation from which to build upon. Just go through it slowly and methodically, type everything in the book along the way and ponder it, and I have no doubt you will learn this language and use it capably."
Eric Wood,4.0,Python Step by Step,September,Other reviews that suggest this book moves too slowly and is repetitive are essentially correct. But I am not saying that is a negative...this is a great book to cement the fundamentals.  Calling this a crash course is a bit of a misnomer...you will not feel as if you are being thrown into the deep end. This takes a measured and gradual series of steps  using reinforcement exercises along the way to get you comfortable with Python.
Jean Pargetter,3.0,Dull Graphics,July,"This book is very clearly written and the exercises simple to follow and advance with. As other reviews have stated, instructions are written comprehensively so that Python skills can be learned without many stumbles."
arcccc,5.0,Pleased,June,"I tried the video tutorials, the Udemy courses, skillshare, youtube bingefest-- nothing stuck. Since I did not have a background in programming, I found myself asking questions like ""okay why did you choose that name for a variable and not this? Why are you changing the variable name now? Is there a specific way for doing this and that? Why are we doing this? Can it be done another way?"" and the lecturer went on without explaining themselves. With this book, the author did just that in a very detailed and concise manner. Everything is broken down like he anticipated the exact questions I had. He is good at teaching. I am glad I found this resource. He should write more books on Python."
Nestor,5.0,"I learnt so much,",July,"Good book, I’m new, good projects"
Jonathan,5.0,Best 10/10,May,I'm not much of a reader but I think this is the only book that I've completely finished. I recommend it to everyone who wants to start in the world of programming
Ortega52,3.0,Too early for a 5 Star,May,"I decided to buy the second edition of this book cause my son suddenly wanted to learn Python.  He asked me if I could recommend a book, so I suggested Python Crash Course.  We are on chapter 2, and noticed that the section on Combining Strings has been omitted on his second edition.  It is not a deal breaker, but I wonder what else has changed/omitted from his Second edition.  Perhaps, he mentions it down the road."
satish,5.0,Best book.,July,Best book to start learning python coding .
Mr magic,3.0,Good for programming fundamentals!,October,I like how the first part of the books explains the fundamentals of programming in python and that you can apply these fundamentals in other languages. My issue with learning part 1 of the book is that I had to keep looking up other explanations on google for methods and some of the concepts. He did not really help the reader understand python syntax. So better explanation in part 1.
J. Hersh,4.0,Great book for learning python! Very informative and fun to follow. Easy read!,August,I enjoyed this book immensely as someone who has tried to get into python multiple times over the past few years and got bored halfway through. I actually found myself enjoying the content of this book so much that I would continually go back into it each day to learn more and practice. After 7+ years I may finally be able to learn Python in its entirety! The projects are also interesting to follow and help wrack your brain around the processes behind the code.
James PJ,5.0,Brilliant Writing,June,"First off, I want to enter a quote from page 173: ""This brings you to an interesting point in your growth as a programmer.  When you wrestle with questions like these, you're thinking at a higher logical level rather than a syntax-focused level.  Your're thinking not about Python, but about how to represent the real world in code.""  This quote reminds me of another: ""the best programming is done by programmers immersed in the environment they are writing for.  I was lucky to be immersed and programming in a clinical environment.  I've been out of that (programming) environment for about eight years and grabbed this book because I'd been missing this kind of thinking.  Matthes is great at teaching syntax and great at getting you thinking about program modeling in the real world.  Great book, but you might need a wee bit of glue to keep the cover on."
RiskyOne,5.0,Excellent resource for beginners.,October,"Over the past 3 years I have worked with one object  oriented programming language, VBA. Basically, I've taught myself by watching countless video, visiting numerous websites, purchasing lessons and books and hours of trial in error. When I decided to take on Python, I wanted to approach it differently and get a good understanding, so I decided to purchase a highly rated beginner's book. Python Crash Course was recommended on a programming website. I decided to purchase it and give it a go. The author of Python Crash Course, Eric Matthes, does a phenomenal job explaining the language and providing simplified examples. What I have found most beneficial is the break down and explanation of each step he provides after almost every example. Giving you the ""why's"" behind the process. I highly recommend this publication to any beginner who wants solid understanding of Python."
B Sherwood,5.0,What a Great place to Start,September,"I am not brand new to programming entirely, but my experience with programming was in C++ over a decade ago.  I have always had a desire to learn to program because why not learn to speak another language that is so useful.  Well this book even though I have only had it for a few days now is amazing.  I have tried learning with the immense amount of YouTube videos out there and have quickly been side tracked.  I like this book because it provides structure to my learning.  I am able to have a ""lesson plan"".  I guess it is kind of old school of me to want a textbook to learn from, but what can I say if it works, it works.  This book is well laid out and easy to understand.  I like that it has been recently updated, which is helpful to be on the same update of python as the book. All together very pleased so far and will continue to use more books by this publisher."
Jodi,5.0,Excellent step by step with online support/resources,May,"I purchased this book for a college class.  Since the class was delivered online, much of my learning was on my own.  This book is an excellent step by step guide from start to finish with easy to comprehend text, as well as examples of code.  It also has three projects to do, a video game (Alien Invasion), a data visualization project, and a web applications project.  I have no coding/programming experience at all and at the end of 8 weeks, I created a pretty awesome video game!  I plan on doing the data visualization project next!  The text is very well written and has online supplements and resources in case you get stuck."
Chen Junzhou,5.0,THE BOOK for Beginners!,May,"After finishing another beginner's book and feeling confused and lost, I am so glad I bought this book. And this is THE book!!! Very clearly organized and thoroughly explained. After introduction of each concept, the author always demonstrates  how to apply it to in your coding, the thought process, and the purpose of each line of codes.  For the practical project, the author shows how to start a project from scratch, and the step by step thinking, coding, refactoring, revising, so detailed that I feel like the author is right next to me guiding me through it. I dont know how anyone else could do a better job! So much better than the other book...  I love it."
Amazon Customer,5.0,Great book for a beginner,April,Book's material is very easy to digest compared to other programming books. The way the author writes out the concepts are very relatable and the vocabulary used isn't trying to sound technical when not necessary. A+ in my book.
Amazon NV customer,5.0,Excellent book,November,"Excellent introduction to Python.  Well organized and very well written.  I didn't go through the latter part on a game example, but got what I needed from the main body of the book.  Thorough description of lists and dictionaries and how to use them.  I've been writing Fortran programs since 1976 and am fluent in C++ and VB.Net, and found this book an excellent resource for learning Python's specifics which are very different from what I'm used to."
Jimmy R. Russell,5.0,Great book. Helped a ton!,October,"This book didn't feel like a crash course but didn't feel like a textbook either. The author briskly reviewed some key basic concepts and gave the odd pointer here or there, and the book promptly moved on to some real-world examples. The author also gives you an overview of what is out there in the Python ecosystem, which is helpful because there is a lot out there. It is not like Java where everything you need is in the API. If you're like me and you had a background in programming already, that's exactly what you were looking for. If you are completely new to programming and you've decided to learn in Python, this would still be a good book to buy but you may want to buy another book to complement it."
Tony,4.0,Worth the purchase!!,May,I am an IT student with no prior knowledge of coding and just finished my first class. It was a struggle and I decided to spend the summer getting better before the next coding course start in the fall. The book covers a great deal but if you are a beginner the author does a great job of not just teaching how to code but also explains what is going on behind the scenes.
Rolands,5.0,Amazing book!,November,"What I liked the most is the author is using very simple language and examples to explain concepts. Thanks to this book I realized that programming isn't so difficult as it initialy seems. Many other tutors fail to do that, they are giving very superficial theory and very hard tasks out from nowhere without explanation but not in this book! I strongly recommend the book to everyone who want to learn programming."
Christopher Hatton,5.0,Perfect for beginners!!,May,This book is perfect for beginners. Easy to understand text and examples. Great resource with great resources for the reader.
Jack,4.0,An interesting book,February,I am just beginning the book.  It does seem promising.
Vaddi,5.0,A wonderful resource for Python Beginners! Weak binding though.,October,"First things first, I'm completely new to programming. I have a fair understanding of propositional logic, and that's it."
Chase,5.0,Good book,June,Good for beginners
B,5.0,The best Python course I’ve found yet.,March,"I’ve tried a lot of the free tutorials online: classes, pdf, etc. and nothing compares to this physical book. It starts off like most tutorials with the user creating the “hello world” program, but then uses each chapter to introduce a new topic while still using the topics previously learned. If I forget something I can easily flip back and refresh my memory. The chapters are short and concise, the appendices are helpful, and the book is easy to follow. I’ve given up many times when trying to use online guides and tutorials, but I find myself wanting to spend my free time working through this book and thoroughly enjoy it."
W. K. Holton,5.0,From your first exception errror to your first Hello World.,March,3 years ago I read this book without knowing much about programming at all.
Jason Guaschino,5.0,10/10 recommend,March,"Can’t recommend this book enough! In my opinion this is better then a college class, better then w3 schools, and better then codecademy! I feel like I’m learning and advancing so quickly with this book!"
L B.,5.0,Buy this book,October,"Seriously, buy this book.  My programming experience prior was limited to a single semester class where all I learned was basic concepts without any actual language skills, and that was over a decade ago.  Less than halfway through this excellent text, and I was already starting the command line game project I had in mind.  Honestly, I was skeptical before and probably wouldn't have bought the book if it had not been discounted, but having seen how quickly I was grasping the concepts, I can wholeheartedly recommend this book at any price point.  There is a reason so many sources suggest this as a wonderful entry point to Python."
Justin,5.0,Its exactly as it says a project based learning system,March,Its good to for what it says. When you are doing your own projects there are resources online and on youtube to help you solve troubleshooting problems when on your own.
T,5.0,This book made coding more understandable than any of the online resources I was using,August,I bought this book after struggling on Codecademy. It's very well written and easy to understand. The way Eric has written this book is exactly how I take notes. It just clicks! Even the harder concepts just need some time and rereading but I was able to follow along with every single exercise. I 100% recommend it for someone who has never coded a single line of Python in their lives. (Btw I recommend Visual Studio Code for your text editor instead of Sublime like the book suggests).
Wesley S. Thomas,5.0,This book has exceeded the expectation of my son.,October,"This review was written by my Son Joshua J. Thomas, who I purchased the book for. He's currently a student studying Cyber Security."
adam majewski,5.0,Great read,April,Absolutely getting bang for your buck here great read with a bunch of information.
satisfied customer,5.0,Excellent Book!,September,"I love this book! I am learning so much! The chapters aren't too long. The hands-on exercises are excellent. The book wanted its readers to install Sublime Text for Python; however, I couldn't program Sublime Text to work. No worries! I used Visual Studio Code to execute Python commands and it worked just fine! All the material in this book is well-written and easy to understand. I am really getting this and it feels great to master yet another programming language.  This is by far the best programming book that I have ever read and purchased. I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn Python. It is no wonder why this book is rated number one! Great buy!"
Collected,5.0,Good introduction for someone who knows nothing about Python,August,"I bought this book because I wanted to help out with a project that involved Python -- I didn't even understand what was required of me. I'm about halfway through, and am already feeling a lot more comfortable about the project. The book lays things out in a very systematic way, with exercise that help you figure out exactly what's going on (and makes lots of mistakes along the way, which is always valuable though annoying at the time) . . ."
RigelulZ,3.0,Great Book if You Are Brand New,November,"Great quality book if you're brand new to programming concepts and languages in general. Having some basic previous programming experience and having read things like ""Eloquent JavaScript"", I found most of the examples to be way too basic. I still found the content the author included and his explanations to be worthwhile reading even for those that are past the very beginner stages of programming. Python is a must have skill in today's technical job market, it is an elegant and effective scripting language with a growing future. I definitely recommend this book as a quick primer or a way to brush up on syntax and learning ""Pythonic"" ways of crafting your code."
Taylor,5.0,Great introductory,July,"my only complaint is, since this is an introductory book, it should give resources or cover common install issues such as placing things in the path. this is needed at the beginning of the book, and without prior programming/systems experience, this could be a huge complication.  being in path may or may not be the default, depending on your system and download specifications. however this book still deserves a five star rating because it is very straight forward, building skills and competency from the ground up.  i also really liked that there was a git and github section included because version control platforms can be confusing at first, but with a straight forward explanation, not hard to get used to."
Chris,5.0,Common sense python!,May,I don't normally do reviews but I felt this book warrants one. Just like anything you buy from anywhere this book might not be for everyone.  Kindly research it before you buy it but I loved it! It helped me grasps the concept of python programming. It really helped me walk through the problems and learn the solutions. The book doesn't feel cheaply made. The paper isn't that bad quality flimsy super thin paper that some books have. I recommend this book to those who want to learn python.
Seth Ward,5.0,Easy to get started with Python,May,"I needed to learn basic Python for a specific project I had in mind. My previous ""code"" experience includes HTML/CSS and enough Javascript to dress up websites and make basic widgets to use at work. My hope with this book was to learn enough to get a barebones version of the project running then hand it off to a real programmer. I finished the first half of the book, which is the basics, and decided to try out a couple ideas before moving on to the ""example projects"" part of the book. The examples are great but some were honestly overkill for what I needed. To my surprise I had a working program in a few days. I recommend this book for anyone starting out with Python."
Mohamed Abd Al Aziz,4.0,tracking no,December,Please learn me the tracking No.
Brian D Bozzuto,5.0,Really outstanding book!,July,I was trying to come up with pandemic activities and started coding python with my 12 year old son and some of his friends. After a couple weeks I turned to this book and it worked out really great. The examples were thorough and well explained. While they lost interest after some of the games I kept going and must say the contents really give a good introduction to python and some important development concepts
David Derocher,5.0,Really good book but bad build quality,June,"I’m only about 60 pages in but this book has taught me more in those 60 pages than I learned as a freshman in college. It does a great job explaining how things work. My only complaint is the quality of the book itself is very poor. The paper separated from the spine almost instantly. I’m sure you could superglue it or something, it’s just annoying. I gave it 5 stars solely for the quality of material inside the book."
Amazon Customer,5.0,Makes learning Python easy and fun,February,"Admittedly I have a little bit of a computer science background, but programming has always been a challenge for me. I got this book after reading the positive reviews, hoping it would make my path to learning Python easier than my path to learning Java was (a nightmare). The concepts laid out in this book are logical and easy to follow. The explanations of code examples are clear. The exercises are useful and relevant. I've been working in this book for over a year and it was absolutely a great purchase."
DM,5.0,Best Python Starter guide I've ever seen!,September,"I've tried several courses before, but this book is the one that has, imho, the best explanations, the best presentation order of information, and the most useful concept order, too.  I highly recomment this one - I'm only 7 chapters in, but this experience will finally get me over the hump of all the other false starts I've had with Python prior to this.  Worth more than the $17, just go for it!  Oh, and I think that I could recommend this book to ages 15+, if there are any interested parties in that age group out there considering this one..."
Jonathan,4.0,Perfect for beginners - wish it was spiral bound,January,"I am taking an online college course for intro to scripting in Python, and there is no book with the course, just an online tutorial that you use. The online ""book"" is streamlined and wasn't cutting it for me. The Crash Course book is so much better and it fills in a lot of gaps. My only complaint is the book should have been spiral bound. The binding isn't great for a book this size and you need the spiral option to have the book stay open while you type in the exercises, which are great. Highly recommend the book for true beginners. Probably too basic for anyone else, but it is at the level i needed."
Stephen R. Roberts,3.0,Truely for the person that doesn't know how to program,January,"I write firmware/software professionally in C/C++/C#.  Recently I started learning Python and BASH.  Got this book to learn Python, the book was a bit long winded. If I was a newbie I'd want it to be wordy."
Amazon Customer,4.0,Good reference and beginner book - leave out the politics,July,"I bought this for class and it’s pretty dang useful.  It’s 99% non-political and just coding, but there’s definitely a push for making coding political in this book and his website. I just want to learn a new job"
CxegCfiJjXRfuN9,5.0,Worth Every Penny!,February,"Let me preface this review by saying that I have zero programming experience. I'm only four chapters into the book and I gotta say - Python is finally making sense to me! I've tried reading ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"" and I have no doubt that it's a good book. However, for me, it was not a good starting point and I found myself lost trying to read through the first few chapters - maybe I'll re-read ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"" afterwards after I finish ""Python Crash Course"". I'll do a follow-up review of this book when I'm done, but that won't be for a while; I'm going at my own pace and ensuring that I understand each topic and lesson. This book is worth the money if you want to learn Python!"
David L.,4.0,"Not bad, but some disappointment",June,"The contents of the book are better than its manufactured quality.  Sadly, less than a week after receiving it, the cover came free of the rest of the book. It  was apparently only held on by two narrow strips of glue on the first and last pages, and no glue holding it to the actual spine!"
Jose Diaz,5.0,Great book to start off with Python!,October,Good book to start off with learning Python. The book really walks you through how to make the commands work with examples and straight to the point explanations. Highly recommend as it as an easy to digest book and includes cool projects to apply the commands that you learn.
Nate Josephs,5.0,It covers Python in a very clear and straightforward way.  The hands on projects are great too!,December,I liked the clear explanations of each topic.  The author explains what each line of code does which helps readers gain an understanding of Python easier.  The assignments further reinforced what was taught.
Mark Oglesby,5.0,Great book!,March,"Great book, taught me more than the college course I was taking."
rbsilva21,5.0,Best intro python book. Lots of hands on projects.,February,"I started to develop some projects in Python, following some internet web pages, everybody suggested this book for a beginner to intermediate Python student. The book provides tons of examples, the codes used in the book are in github as well if you got stuck in some examples, so is great to start thinking as a python developer. At the end of the book, there are 3 hands-on projects, a game to develop, a data visualization project and a web app using Django. I started with Django, I connected with my AWS account to use the web app in a cloud environment, so it gave me a lot of ideas to develop by myself using the book."
Joseph Hutchens,5.0,"Great book, Easy read and Easy to follow",September,This book is great for people who just learned Python or learned Python in recent years. Easy to follow and many projects to enjoy over the course of the read. The index is great for people who wants to jump around. I will recommend this book to others. Note: This book is not for kids.
Charlie L,4.0,First Python book,November,Very basic contents. Great for beginners.
Helper,5.0,Great Explanations,February,If you like to understand what each command does in Python then this book is for you.  A Python class can teach you how to write a project and as the project gets completed you get familiar with the different commands.  I prefer learning a programming language by learning the language commands first and then putting them together to write an innovative program.
Gabi Q,5.0,Worth it,July,"This book is awesome. The author does a great job explaining new concepts and showing examples that make it easy to understand. As the material gets harder, the author does an excellent job at reintroducing concepts learned in previous chapters to help you write better code. I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone wanting to get familiar with Python."
Amazon Customer,5.0,Perfect for Tech-Challenged Python Learners,August,"I should start this review with the qualifier that I am extremely tech challenged. I've wanted to learn Python for a long time to help me with my work, but every book or course I had looked at previously was too quick, too advanced, and assumed you knew too much about programming and computers. This book literally starts with downloading Python correctly onto your computer - something I've had difficulty in the past with other programs! This book is perfect if you need a slow-and-steady introduction to Python with a lot of hand-holding and workable examples."
Lily,4.0,The contents are excellent!,September,"I have taken Learn Python the Hard Way online as well as codecademy. They both had its good and not so good, and I wanted to try this book. It was very complementary. The projects are great, easy to understand with detailed explanation. I took a start down, because of poor binding. They sent me a replacement with a different printing, but it was the same thing. Kindle version could be better."
Maintenance Man,3.0,Troubling at First,October,"I bought this book for the second half that has the projects. The first section was annoying because it was missing Pygame code that allows you to close the game window. Luckily I knew some Pygame and could fix it myself. I was going to give this book low marks for such a glaring oversight. However the second section with APIs was top notch. The last section attempted to cover way too much - Django, Bootstrap, Git, Heroku. Those topics could have easily filled a book on their own."
Bill L.,5.0,Just built my First Actual Django App,August,"I already knew quite a bit of Python and Flask, but never quite made the jump to Django. It's such a useful framework, especially the Database setup and Admin console are such a huge advantage over Flask. I haven't dug much into the other sections, but this section was worth the price alone."
Gino Murin,5.0,Perfect for beginners,December,"As a beginner programmer having very little knowledge, this book has done more for me in two weeks than any of the ""bootcamps"" or anything available online. The book goes in depth and gives you a good foundation in programming....Helps you to understand the underlying concepts and not just memorize code. Found this in numerous locations for free online but decide to purchase out of appreciation for what this has done for my development as a programmer. Highly recommend!"
MNorris,4.0,"Great content, but terrible binding and flimsy cover",June,They say don't judge a book by it's cover - and that's why I'm still giving it 4 stars. The actual content of the book is wonderfully written and explained. I really like that the author takes you through writing full game (like Space Invaders) using everything you have learned. I highly recommend it.
Caner,5.0,This book can teach anyone how to code!,July,I think I recently had a chance to review many Python books and this one has by far the most efficient organization that teaches you the basics of coding with solid examples. The second part of the book consists of useful projects in which you literally use any single knowledge you gain in the first part.
Dear MR.J,4.0,Good for beginner but does not go too far or deep,June,What is good about it? It teaches you the basics of Python But it does not have any advanced materials inside.  Evey little example is well explained. It has a lot of examples are presented. It also asked readers to do exercises after concept.
kdfuser,5.0,Very enjoyable read,August,"Just finished the book and followed the code all way, even did some of the ""Try this yourself"" exercises.  Very well organized.  6 stars on that.  Code in the book was accurate and worked as expected.  I didn't just try the code from the resource web site.  I actually typed in every line from the book and made it all the way to deployment.  (Quite an accomplishment, I say. :-))."
Sam2013,5.0,"A great place to start learning python, regardless of prior knowledge in programming.",February,"This book was amazing. Very easy to follow and understand. I think what I appreciate the most about it was the exercises that were frequently presented throughout the book. This gives you an opportunity to immediately practice the skills while they are fresh in your mind. The only way to really remember python syntax in my opinion is practice, so why not get started as soon as you learn it?"
Andrew,5.0,Very good python book !!!!,February,Very good python book !!!!
Peanuts,5.0,Best python course.,December,Easy to understand. Not bloated. This book will teach you Python programming. Its the best python beginner course that I have found.
Bob S.,4.0,"So far, so good - but terrible binding",July,"I’m just getting into this book and am really enjoying it. The author provides easy to read / follow concepts and instructions. The book cover though? It broke before I made it to the Introduction of the book - literally 5 minutes of holding the book. I imagined using this book to take notes in and as a go-to resource, but my fear is it physically won’t hold up as I keep turning pages."
KB,5.0,It teaches python in the most explicted way for beginners,November,"The labeling is clean and organized, and it explains code in a very descriptive way, it's very a well-thought-out process, and it makes coding very self-explanatory overall I recommend this book."
Nicholas Broussard,5.0,Awesome Python Book,October,"This book is truly awesome. It teaches basic Python programming from the ground up. There's just the right amount of detail. I quickly became proficient at writing for loops, while loops, if-elif-else statements, and functions. The book is prefaced with nice explanations of the differences between lists, dictionaries, etc. I mostly loved the breakdowns of each example. The author gives a step-by-step explanation for each. This is clearer and more accessible than any other book I've seen."
agg_007,5.0,The best way to get started in Python!,June,This book will take you from zero to hero (well on the path to hero) in Python!
Julie,5.0,Pivoting,January,The well written open-ended exercises make pivoting into and nurturing a new career pathway a joy.
Sheldon,5.0,Skills to Everyday Python Projects for Everyday Python Programmers,April,I plain and simply love this book. I own both digital copies of the first and second edition. As an educator in technology this is on my recommended reading list for students wanting to learn Python. I work in the Net DevOps space and the material here can be translated to infrastructure monitoring. GREAT READ!!!
Gloria J,4.0,Son purchased himself,June,The item was received in a timely manner and was as it was described. I have no major complaints at this time.  Son purchased to enhance his career.
Klein,4.0,Cover WILL Fall Off,November,"I bought this for a friend as a gift, knowing the cover would fall off. It did."
Patrick,5.0,BEST PYTHON CRASH COURSE EVER!,June,"This was my first book not only on Python but programming in general.... I have to say this is very easy for a beginner to start out with and actually learn from.... Read through it first, then go back through it and actually do the code and ex...."
yifengrao,5.0,good,March,good
Markeith Singletary,5.0,I am very satisfied!,January,A wonderful book! I am learning a lot.
"Michael, B",5.0,"Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition,",September,1st off is IMHO the book is outstanding and allot of time and thought went into it.  I look forward more books by Eric.
Beka,5.0,No need any previous knowledge in Python,February,"this book is amazing it is done in an excellent style, and you get knowledge step by step. There are so many exciting exercises that will give you self-confidence when you will find a way to solve it."
kamgrn,5.0,10 stars!!,December,"I’m transitioning into a new role at work, and python is a requirement.  I wasted many hours on 2 udemy courses and a different python book.  Completely useless for a newbie to programming.  And then I found this book!  Lifesaver.  It literally walks thru everything step by step and is in a language that Makes sense and doesn’t have that techie over the head jargon. I would recommend this book to ANYONE wanting to learn Python. I will definitely be looking for other books by this author.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
Amazon Customer,4.0,Terrible binding!,September,Book just arrived so I cannot comment on its content. Just wanted to confirm what others have said about the binding. You can already see the space between the cover and spine of the book. Maybe “no starch press” should change their name to “no glue press.”
Edwin,5.0,Excelente texto de auto aprendizaje,January,Aprende con ejemplos prácticos y sencillos !!
Wesley preston,5.0,Damn fine,March,"I am in the process of using this book and I loved it. This is one of the few books I can actually read and understand everything that is happening. The few problems I did have, I looked up and the online forums had answers to all my questions. 5/5 programming book"
Fil,2.0,Not up to date,September,"Overall good information, however I found less helpfull than looking up in Google."
Tanyia Wynee,5.0,Good to know,January,Great read DIDNT take long
Theresa,4.0,A good start,February,The book started off pretty easy and the author is true to his word about helping the student with questions as long as it is about something from his book.
Brayden,5.0,print(this is a great book to learn python),March,This book starts you from the basics from installing python to writing your first program. i am a good couple chapters in and i love how it’s written. everything is clearly explained with diagrams to help you troubleshoot your programs. it also has included projects that teach you while you make something. the book encourages you to experiment with what it’s teaching you to learn. it really is a great book to help learn python and i highly recommend it.
superthaix,5.0,The champion!,March,"Fantastic book, especially for beginners. Actually the best book ever to learn Python. Clear and easy to understand. Everything is explained very well. Just to let you know I have read at least 50 other Python beginners books, and this is the champion. The problem is that 99% of the beginners books are written by experienced programmers who are unfortunately horrible teachers. This book is the exception and gives you more confidence that you can actually learn Python."
Casey Sheehan,5.0,Learned so much!,June,"Have spent a couple of weeks plowing through this. It is extremely well written,  I've had no issue understanding any examples or instructions. Has taught me so much so far. Highly recommend for any one who doesn't know where to start."
Selina,5.0,very nice book to read!,October,The author described the complicated things as easy to read. I read it every night and get a lot from it! Recommed!
Michael G. Myers,5.0,Very easy to learn,November,Python was a new language for me.  I had programed primarily in C and then c#. Love python and this book is an excellent  introduction to python.  Every line of code for the projects is in the book and explained line by line.  I recommend it even  if you have no programing experience.
LoneStarBroker,5.0,Perfect,December,Book is great! I am a happy camper.
jabari Webster,5.0,GREAT for ANYBODY!,May,I bought this book to teach myself python after learning C++ and its very understandable and easy to read. Everything it teaches is clear and precise so if you are learning for school or self teaching I recommend this book! Its so good I logged onto my account a 3AM in the morning to write a review! FR though this is a good book you won't regret it.
William letmon,5.0,Fulfilled as agreed,January,Skill enhancement
JD,1.0,Very Politically Aligned Company,June,I was excited to receive this book and begin reading the text. In the first chapter they provide two links to navigate to for additional information. The link directs you to reading how the US is racist. The website goes on to provide BLM support and information. This was very disappointing. I don't like to have politics shoved down my throat. I'll be returning this item and will look for another company to do my business with.
md khan,5.0,Good book,January,A good book

Angel Vidal,5.0,Get this book now! 1000/1000,January,"This book is amazing and in a ouple hours I've been able to learn functions,variables,values and strings. Also with the basic knowledge that I learned so far with the book I was able to create a simple program that says and greets my friend's name in order."
J,5.0,"I love it, great for students",October,"Taken back from the price to value ratio with this book, a few hundred pages and great starter and novice explanations and elaborations. Even has you follow along with practices from within the book. I’m talking my first year of SD classes and this book is helping a lot with the python side of it."
cpbride,5.0,This is the book to get,February,I have been trying to learn a python for five years using video courses. I decided to switch things up and try learning from a book. This is the book to get. I'm finally understanding concepts I have spent years trying to internalize.
MJS,5.0,"Content awesome, pacing awesome",March,The content of the book is great though I wish the font size was larger. The pacing of the course is perfect for me. No complaints regarding the content.
Jared Meldrum,5.0,Great book!,November,I got this book for some added material in one of my programming courses and it’s helped a ton! It’s a really good step by step guide and has you try a lot of the code on your own so you can see how it all works out
MB16v,4.0,No Starch Press with No Glue for the cover,August,3rd day and the cover is already coming unglued. Hoping the content holds up.  Odd that the publisher is called No Starch Press....maybe they need to use starch to glue their book together.
Francisco Monzon,5.0,Really a very good book. Thank a lot.,June,"I recommend this Book. It is excellent to starting learning Python. Really was much better that I ever waited.  Just I suggest to add exercises more complex that need to be resolved with matters included in before chapters. Thank so much to the author, Eric Matthes. You should be very proud, cause really You did a very good job."
Makhmudjon Sobirov,5.0,"Didn't understand anything, but very interesting book",November,"Didn't understand anything, but very interesting book"
Tolete,5.0,Excellent book!,April,I highly recommend this book for those who want to learn the basics Python. It goes through great details and explains things very clearly with examples of what to do and what to avoid doing.
Carlos Salvatierra,5.0,Great book. Must read!,February,Great book. It can be used for anyone with beginning knowledge. A must have book. Videos do not cover the pieces that the author covers here. I wish I had read this book a few years ago. Great job Eric!
Janet Fenstermacher,4.0,Very helpful with my class,July,"The only thing I have noticed so far is that the index pages in the back skip a few things. I believe a page was left out, I tried to look up integers and numbers, there is no M, N, and O in the index section.  Very detailed on everything I have looked up so far and I am very happy with the book."
Dio,5.0,Great starting material.,November,Well worth the 20. Not sure if I'll stick with python though.. I've worked with Java before and I sucked. I'm giving python a try though. Liking things so far. I am looking forward to any python books the author has to offer in the future. Thanks.
M.Z.,5.0,Makes learning Python much simpler than any other resource I’ve tried,April,I’m really impressed with this book. It breaks down the fundamentals into easily digestible and implementable pieces. The language is concise and the examples are easy to customize into something more meaningful to what I am trying to do. I’ve owned 3 other books on Python and took an undergrad course in it but this is by far the best resource I’ve used.
badmofo,5.0,Excellent,May,Great book.  I’m on chapter 7 now and I am really happy with how the content is laid out in plain English and goes through each line of code step-by-step.
Shay,2.0,Don't buy this if you want to seriously code in Python,December,This book has taught me again that not everything that is popular is necessarly good or even moderately good.
Molotov,5.0,Great content,July,"The book is well structured with useful examples to follow.  The focus is on best practices.  The exercises are semi-cumulative and galvanize the reader to think of the different ways a task can be accomplished.  If you put in a small amount of effort, this book will give you much in return."
Amazon Customer,3.0,"Good instruction, poor physical quality of the book.",February,"The information and examples inside the book are excellent and I'm learning very much.  It's well written and everything is explained thoroughly for a real beginner like myself.  I didn't give it five stars because the binding of the book broke after a few weeks of normal use.  The book looks like its near new condition, but the binding is broken.  Kind of a pain to have to fix it after a short period of time."
Rory Derrick,5.0,Great resource for learning Python,April,"I have several ""no starch press "" books and have used them all for reference purposes. Python Crash course has covered many topics very well. I'm very pleased with it."
Jace,5.0,Great for learning python,January,Tried taking online courses to learn python and hated that structure. This book is well written and easy to understand. Only had it for a week and can't put it down. Makes learning Python fun!
S.M.Simmons,4.0,This is a read an hands on approach book!,February,"Unfortunately I have to agree the glue at the base of the book, is not adhering to the pages."
Jacob,4.0,Don't judge a book by it's cover,October,"Content is really good. But as seen in other reviews, the glue holding the cover gives out and the cover falls off."
J,5.0,Great for starters,February,So far so good. On the 5th chapter currently; the book is pretty straight forward and walks you through step by step. Would recommend for beginners with no previous coding experience.
Anthony Ortega,5.0,"Great book, love the content.",July,"Just as I expected, learning programing is not a simple subject, yet author does a great work."
P. Camargo,3.0,"If your already developer, skip this book, it looks great for an absolute beginner",January,"As a developer in other languages, this book was a little too beginner for me, it spends chapters going over basic data types, arrays (lists), things that anyone would already know if they've wrote code in other languages.  I don't mean to imply the book is bad, I imagine if I had no experience this is a great way to get into it, but I was disappointed when I read the introduction and it mentioned the target audience was a widespread target of people with no coding experience to college course students; reading that I knew and confirmed after some reading that it was going to have some painfully basic parts."
Pravin Pathak,5.0,Very good book to start learning Python.  3 complete projects from different fields,May,Loved this book. Nicely explains basic concepts along with code. Each code line is explained properly.  Lots of code lines to explain.  Three projects at the end are really great way to enforce language and also to introduce different Python modules.  I found them really helpful.
Ahmed,5.0,A Magic book!,March,"Don't waste your time watching videos, stick with this book if you need to write a code. I wrote some code :)"
Eva Frantz,5.0,Great new learning resource,December,"I agree with other commentors. Book binding is meh, but the content is great for a beginner. The book clearly walks through examples and exercises. Additional, the book teaches good coding practices!"
h20Lover,5.0,A must have,November,"I read the review before being this book and to be honest I was torn, however this book is 10/10 for me. Give it a try. It breaks down ""complex"" problems into direct and clear solutions. You don't have to go back and forth trying to catch up with his flow. I'm not even half way and I can super vouch for this book."
Out West,1.0,"Terrible Book - Wastes Time, Ink, Paper Codings Usless App's To Demonstrate Basic Stuff",June,Save your money!  Another terrible book that wastes good paper using 450 pages of the 500 pages to show reader how to build some stupid program to demonstrate usage.

Turtleboi,3.0,Binding coming off,June,Exctoed about the books content which I know will prob be great. But not hyped about the fact I can see the other side through the binding. Very annoying that I have to proactively buy book glue for a week or month from now when the cover comes off.
Weronika,5.0,Go to book for Python,July,This book finally helped me learned python after feel stuck and confused for months. It breaks it down and explains it beautifully. If you’re struggling with python on completely new to this then this is the go to book.

Jonathan A. Titus,1.0,AWFUL:  Sparse index makes info difficult to find info.,October,"The index in this book is awful so one star is the best I can offer.  Wish I could give it zero stars.  I have programmed in other languages and aimed to learn about Python so as a volunteer I could answer students' questions in a junior-high programming course.  The index is horrible and newcomers will find it difficult to locate important information.  As an example, the use of a loop in software lets a computer do something many times.  The word ""loop"" is not in the index.  That goes for """"else"" and ""elif,"" also important commands.  The entry labeled ""for loops"" points readers to a chapter labeled ""Working with Lists.""  Granted, this chapter includes information about loops, but you need to go to Chapter 7, ""User Input and while loops.""  The topic of loops should have its own chapter.  I need to find a better book and not one with half the pages devoted to games, data visualization, and web applications, which I have no use for. Revised 12-17-2020"

Ikechukwu,5.0,Very helpful,January,Very detailed
Jason Bowers,1.0,No way to get started!,September,I purchased this book only to be left out without a way to use the python terminal.  I was already stuck at shift left click.

David A Patten,1.0,Single point of failure: pygame,February,"There are no clear instructions for how to install pygame. The first half of the book was great. But unfortunately, half the book was useless because it requires pygame. I followed the book verbatim: $ python -m pip install --user pygame and kept getting syntax errors. Python doesn't recognize $ as a valid input.  I googled around for solutions and got a variety of other errors. The author didn't seem to anticipate the magnitude of the problem if pygame couldn't be installed given his one line of instruction."

Don,1.0,Don't waste your money!,May,"A disaster from the getgo: on page 2 the author listed a requirement to download a 'sublime text' program, which froze my computer, requiring a reset and several hours reinstalling deleted programs. I never made it past Chapter 1, where he kept referring to 'hello_world.py', which I was unable to correlate to the 'print' command. He notes that a text editor is necessary, but doesn't provide any specific editor, such as PyCharm. Wouldn't recommend this to a compete novice, such as myself."

Terry S. Barker,2.0,"New book, but cover nearly ripped off",July,"This was supposed to be a new book, but on arrival, the front cover was nearly ripped off (only top inch still attached)"
User,2.0,Fair resource.,May,Seems excessively 'wordy' and Binding broke after 2 days.
BB FAN,1.0,Project based learning ?,August,Project based learning is the WORST!!! this book is so bad I don't even know how it got all those reviews.
Joshua Hanson,5.0,From 0 to coder,July,"Having failed multiple times to learn to code, I tried again with this book and had a breakthrough!"
Rosalie,1.0,Not very useful,May,"I took a programming course via a university, and this was the textbook required. Did not help at all with learning python."
Project,1.0,Very hard to fallow,May,"I was really looking forward to this book ,but in all honesty the book itself is very hard to fallow the text editor they want you to fallow has no instructions on how to properly install"
Arif Hossain,1.0,The book binding loosening after 4 days of use,August,The book content is fine. The book binding is so bad that it breaking up in just 4 days of use. I have never encountered anything like this before.
Amazon Customer,1.0,If you are a beginner start somewhere else,September,Did not live up to expectations for simplicity or helpfulness. Possibly not for beginners and was impossible for me to complete the first chapter
John Harp,1.0,There are better sources sans the politics.,July,"Teach, don't preach; Left or Right."
E. Fernandez,1.0,Unglued book binding,May,Book is good but I just got it today and the book binding is unglued. It is coming apart.
Jessica Mangiameli,5.0,Best Book for Python Beginners.,April,"I took an online introduction class to Python and had a very hard time with it. I ordered this book after and was able to learn the basics of Python very quickly. It has short exercises throughout the chapters that really help you practice, maintain and build onto your Python skills. It’s very well written and easy to understand. I purchased my book a while ago and have had no issues with it falling apart."
J.W.,1.0,OUT OF DATE,November,out of date and NOT compatible with the latest iterations of the PYTHON language
Kevin Broderick,5.0,Great for beginners,April,This book started my Python learning. I supplemented with online info as well as used a mobile app and online learning course.
LoneWolf,5.0,Really good for learning Python. Well written and easy to follow examples.,March,"This book if taken seriously will ingrain the basics into your head. The book might be for python beginneers but there is a lot to cover and many excercises to do. I am an intermediate level C programmer and  compared to C, python is incredibly large but fun to learn.  This book covers everything to get you going to more intermediate level programming."
Amazon Customer,5.0,Book is great,March,"I love the breakdown of code fragments for tighter explanation.  I do wish the index was better, but this book will make you competent."
MUSTAFA OZGUR KILICARSLAN,1.0,So so,September,So so
Sophie Crash,5.0,Hands on learning in the paperback book,July,"I wanted a new hobby I can do from home. I’m a total beginner, even needed the instructions on how to open the command prompt! So I’m definitely learning a lot already. The book is really long, like a textbook, but since it is a paperback it is not so heavy. I really like the texture of the cover, it isn’t glossy like most textbooks. I like that the content in the book gets hands-on almost right away. The book is perfectly up to date and the programs it requires are also free."
Dan Hanson,4.0,"Python, yes but the skills apply to other languages",June,Edition 2 is cleaned up and better organized and focuses on Python 3 only (no reason to learn Python 2 anymore.)  While it uses Python to teach you to code it also teaches clean programming skills that apply to most other languages.
Erik T.,4.0,Absolutely NOT SUITABLE for experienced programmers!,July,"This book came recommended in several searches on ""Best Python Book for EXPERIENCED programmers"". Simply put, while this book appears quite well written for complete novices who have never programmed in another language before, it's absolutely not suitable for experienced programmers who seek to learn Python."
Steven,5.0,The Absolute Best for Learning Python,May,Pros:
natalia c,5.0,Enseña desde lo básico y muy bien explicado,July,"Después de tener muchos problemas con libros y tutoriales que ""asumen"" que sabes ciertas cosas de programación, este libro fue una grata sorpresa. Me ENCANTA la forma en que están estructurados los temas y la buena explicación del autor en cada uno de estos."
Taylor,5.0,"GREAT for beginners- Simple, clear, and easy to understand.",May,## Allow me to preface by saying I’m only 5 chapters in and will update my review if need be if my opinion changes.
John Smith,5.0,Superbly written! Takes you from Hello World to Classes to Error Handling and much more!,May,"The book is very nicely organized with all the usual ""Installation"" chapters at the end of the book in an Appendix.  If I said that this is THE BEST BOOK ON PYTHON currently (May 2020), I won't be exaggerating at all. I ordered (and unfortunately returned) a few of the Python books until I found this one. Along with the"
Angela,5.0,"Finally, something that makes sense",September,"I have been trying to learn to code off and on for years and years. This is the first resource I've tried that actually helps me understand what I'm doing. I got it quite a while ago and got to the Dictionary section, I think. Then I lost interest. I started in on it again maybe a week ago because I'm trying to become employable. I started from the beginning and I'm almost to Dictionaries and I'm doing pretty well with it."
merchant,5.0,Eric deserves a prize!,April,"Let me say that I have tried my hands at programming many times. I started with C, C++, Java, etc. years ago."
Oliver,5.0,excellent,August,love it
dc rogers,4.0,Is Monty Aware?,October,"A great book to start learning python from scratch. I am hands on and thos book explains how things work, why things work, and allows you to put things into practice. It even touches on django, api, and python for web dev briefly towards the end and opens doors to so many other avenues. I do recommend and also to follow up with impractical python projects and/or automate the boring stuff by the same publisher."
PGM,5.0,Excellent beginner book on python,December,"You can learn python on your own with this book.  I have followed it page by page and am writing python programs.  I have had very few problems understanding what is written or expected in the ""try it yourself"" sections.  It is logical and orderly.  My sister and a friend are also learning python using this book and they feel the same. None of us have had prior programming experience. I am almost half way through the book. It was definitely worth the purchase (my company purchased this book for me from Amazon)."
Eduardo g.,5.0,!!!!!! READ !!!!!!,October,"If you are like what I was a few months ago! Like did not know any programming language like, Not no one drip of coding like NOTHING!!! This book will really help you. Seriously. I actually sent the author a thank you email and he actually replied which was cool. But because of python I picked up java really quick. Because of this book GUI was such an easy thing to learn and if you're like me ""GUI"" just scared you like what the F is that well don't worry this book will give you literally every tool you'll need even ones you won't. Do yourself a favor get it!"
Homayoun Birangi,5.0,One of the best Python programming books,February,"As a C++ programmer that knew a little bit about Python, I started reading this book on weekends. The books is so clear in explaining the subjects at hand that makes me wondering how much effort and patient the author has put in writing the book. After explaining the basics in the first few chapters, more advanced topics such as Classes, Inheritance and Files are explained. The second half of the book covers 3 projects. I learned more doing the 3 projects than anything else. I wish the author writes another Python book with more advances topics. I will buy one."
Z,5.0,A terrifically written guide for absolute beginners.,May,"I've tried to learn to program several times in the past and always quit because the learning curve always seemed too difficult.  This book is so well written, everything is perfectly explained. I'm super impressed.  I'm only 100 pages in  but I've learned so much. I sent some code i'd written to a friend of mine who works at NASA, he was impressed to hear that i'd only been learning Python for 2 weeks. This book is a beginner's course in Python written by a terrific teacher. Highly recommended."
Dr. Stephen S. Hamilton,5.0,Very Comprehensive Book,January,"I received this book as a gift, and found it to be extremely well written.  It contains lots of sample code and detailed explanations of what that code is doing.  The ""Try It Yourself"" section at the end of each chapter allows the reader to try their hand at programming.  Finally, the second part of the book features three comprehensive projects to reinforce all the skills learned earlier.  Overall, a very good book ... for someone with a little prior programming experience."
Eric G. Reyes,5.0,"Good book, excellent author, very responsive and genuinely cares for newbies.",January,"This is actually my 2nd introduction to Python.  As a newbie, ran into a problem immediately. Emailed the author and was pleasantly surprised for an immediate response and advise.  Author seems to genuinely care for newbies like me."
xyz,5.0,You won’t regret it,June,Level: Beginner
Amazon Customer,5.0,Add Python to PATH,June,"I am a beginner programmer. In my first python installation, I had omitted to select Add Python 3.7 to PATH in the installer, the hello_world.py file in Chapter 1 could not work, and it’s frustrating and worrisome to troubleshoot for a beginner."
Isaac Barrow,5.0,Rating for 1st Edition,May,"As a decent programmer in other languages, I bought the first kindle edition of this book to learn python 3 from scratch. I found it to be excellent with clear, step-by-step explanations and practice exercises - haven't got to the projects yet. I am sure that even someone with zero programming knowledge would benefit."
RAUL VELEZ,5.0,Amazing book to learn python,April,"The way this book is structured and the amount of examples and exercises that it has, really helps you to learn Python efficiently. In addition to this, the projects that it has , allows you to consolidate your knowledge with hands-on and fun projects.  I strongly recommend this book for those that are interested in learning Python."
Joseph J. Pedalino,5.0,Great Book to start Python Programming,September,"Easy to follow and the concepts are immediately followed with examples and ""Try it Yourself"" exercises so you won't have to refer too far back for the theory. Small programs make it easy to follow the concepts and the exercises build on the concepts. Great book to have as a reference on your bookshelf."
Sharon,5.0,Great book if you know nothing.,December,Really enjoying this book. Helps you set up a work environment with free software to get started with. Explains in great detail every topic. I knew nothing about programming but wanted to learn to help automate and this is a great first step book. Highly recommend everyone who uses python to add this book in your library. A++++
Jennifer Zadka,5.0,Deep-dive into the Details,November,"In this book, Al shows a lot of important insights about the day-to-day techniques needed to be a Python master. I have already recommended the book to the junior engineers in my team."
ParchmentFan,5.0,Hands down the BEST beginners book for Python 3,May,"Python Crash Course is hands down the best beginners book for Python 3. When coupled with Automate the Boring Stuff also from No Starch, a beginner will have everything needed to grow awesome python skills. Don't even look elsewhere. Buy this book now."
Dula Temesgen,5.0,Best book for beginners to learn python,October,Buy this book. It's well organized and just an absolutely amazing resource to begin your python journey.
KEITH J KAY,5.0,Good book to start with for learning Python.,October,"This book is a great introduction to Python, whether you are new to programming or experienced in another language already. Clear step by step breakdowns of the example code provides a better understanding of the code than other ""cookbook"" approaches to learning a language."
Sharquisha,5.0,Great book for new coders,December,really good book but i had to return due to it being way to easy for my experience but if you are new to coding then this is a great fit for you
Rafael,5.0,Hooked,January,I like the clarity and how in-depth it goes. I am only on the third chapter as I just bought it with my Christmas money and am totally hooked.
Konstantinos-N,5.0,This is the book to start learning Python,January,Very good work. Introduces gradually core language concepts and builds up on them in a manner that is both accessible and appropriate for beginners.
Sean Goodwin,5.0,Great place to start,February,This is an awesome book for anyone looking to learn about programming in Python
Amazon Customer,5.0,Very helpful and thorough,September,Good introduction to python with helpful computer science concepts as well
J. Neal,5.0,New to python or even someone who wants to understand the basics?,May,You should buy this book even if you have some experience with Python and need a refresher on the basics and specifically Python 3.
Efren Vargas,5.0,Worth the Money,December,Great book
Shaahin,5.0,Best python book to start python!,June,Absolutely fantastic and to the point Python book!
Marcel Dupasquier,5.0,The updated preface,May,"For all who want to compare the 1st to the 2nd edition, here the Preface to the Second Edition."
RonLev,3.0,"Some essential things are missing here,",April,"First admission:  I didn't buy the book.  Because?  I checked the index and there is nothing on pandas or numpy, two of the most popular and important packages.  In 500+ pages you couldn't squeeze these into the book?"
Robert V.,1.0,Trivial examples and exercises,July,"Of all of the things I've used to learn Python over the past 2 years, this book was the absolute worst. I think it's popular because it gives people a false sense that they understand the material, but all it does is set you up for failure when you try and do something that is slightly different from one of the examples in the book. As an example of what I mean, the book spends pages talking about how to create a list of favorite pizza toppings (something that should really take a couple of lines of explanation), and then there is an exercise to create a list of your favorite places in the world. Now if you know no Python, and I say this is a list of pizza toppings in Python, I would argue that you could probably give me a list of favorite cities in Python without ever having the slightest idea of what a Python list is. Pepperoni....let's replace that with Denver.........Meatballs.....you're now New York. It would be one thing if this was just the introductory exercise on lists and the exercises then progress to get more difficult. But this is literally true of every exercise in the entire book."
Old Sub Sailor,1.0,I can not recommend this book. It falls short in teaching what is used.,August,HOMEBREW USERS you already know terminal and the command line. You can download Homebrew Python and not bother with Python.org.
Tony,2.0,"Good and Easy Learning, Formatting is Wanting",June,The substance and the way Python is taught is easy to understand and intuitive. It’s a good place to start for someone like me who have zero coding knowledge prior.
Mikey A.,2.0,Great book! But where do i download the ship from in the AlienInvasion project?,May,"I tried to go to resources in the link that's shared in the book, but couldn't find anything."
RoBe,1.0,Show me updated preface,May,Not a chance I will purchase the book when I can't even read the Preface to the new edition using preview functionality. What is the point of preview if I can't see what differentiates this book from previous edition?
Kindle User,1.0,Hard to Follow. Poor Explanations.,June,"In case you are looking for text to learn Python from scratch, just look else where. This author himself needs to learn it in the first place."
alrightalrightalright,5.0,So good,January,"I am about 8 chapters into this book. So, I haven’t finished it yet, but I wanted to give my thoughts so far."
Gavriel,5.0,The best textbook I have ever read; bar none,October,"I'm a computer scientist from a family of teachers, professors, and IT specialists; I don't know how many people realize how rare it is to have someone qualified to write a textbook, who has a balanced enough perspective to understand a students generalist foundation without being demeaning; this book is written in a way that briefly answers why, where someone would think ""why this, not that"", addressing common issues preemptively with solutions to avoid losing the trust of the student."
Nicholas Andresen,5.0,"A great way to learn programming, not just Python",June,"This is the first book I used to learn Python, before I had any experience programming. While it is a thick book, the many examples and well-paced walkthrough from the basics to importing modules and creating a 2D game are great resources to gain comfort and muscle memory for writing code. This book helped me gain a foundation in code that prepared me to learn other programming languages like Javascript, C++, and C#. Overall, this would be a great first book for those interested in learning to code."
ARad,5.0,Very good book for beginners or people with some previous background,August,"I purchased this book to add to my programing knowledge . I studied Visual Basic back then in when i used to go to school. Coming from VB programming, this book was extremely easy to follow. The author has real life examples for everything you learn in the book. I definitely recommend this book even over video courses. after reading 8 chapters I am able to write very basic programs that works."
Dirkster,5.0,Great book for beginners,January,"I started learning Python with online app courses, but noticed they tend to have learning gaps.  Started going through this book, and it's great.  Takes the time to explain why you do certain things in Python, as well as show good examples.  The exercises are step by step, and so far I've had no issues.  The only challenge I've had so far is working with and learning how to use text editors.  I recommend Visual Studio Code over what is recommended in the book."
Amazon Customer,5.0,Great Read,January,"Honestly? I’ve learned a lot. I’m taking a course on Udemy, watching YouTube videos, using every resource I can and this book just puts things in a way you can really understand and practice. My book came with its spine in tact(it still is)"
RJA,5.0,Easy to learn,August,This is exactly what I was looking for.  Easy and interesting method of learning python3.  Highly recommended for those starting out or have not touched python for awhile.
Alina Kostina,5.0,Recommend it for beginners,November,"I recommend it for beginners! Eric Matthes showed and explained every step in python. It helps me not to give up and learn more about programming. If you want to start a new career, this book will help you!"
Josh,5.0,Well written,April,"Good so far, seems to cover everything I need and is well written."
George,5.0,Great Book,December,still haven't finish the book but until now its fairly good and easy to understand for beginners
Nic,5.0,Python on a plane,June,"For once, I'm not tired of these motherfu#%kin' snakes"
Jnynpl,5.0,Good book,November,Easy to understand
meadows_hands,5.0,This helped after so many failed attempts!,February,"I am 10 days in and can't believe how fast I'm picking this up! I've tried probably ten times to learn how to code and gave up after entering ""tutorial hell""."
acupsf,5.0,Not really a review,August,"Rather a typo report: In the title ""...: 2Nd edition"" -- 'N' should be lower case, right?"
alex,5.0,Good reading before the book itself falls apart!,September,"Content is good and easy to understand.  Suitable for a beginner like me.  BUT! ""No Starch Press"", the publisher of this book ought to change their name to ""No Glue Press"" as the book has started to come apart.  Did not even get to Chapter 4 when it unbound!"
Rozz Yobb,5.0,This book has my recommendation.,May,This book is lit.  Great for a beginner or if you’re an intermediate user brushing up on skills.  The projects are great for a beginner and even some challenges for a programmer who is not a newbie to python.  The author of this book has a few great YouTube videos as well.
John Doe,1.0,Errors in code and pushes his political views to reader.,June,"This book would of been perfect if it weren't for errors in coding and pushy political views. In a book meant to help children, teens, and adults learn python; there's no need for politics."
J. A. Grogan,5.0,Comprehensive and long Python Crash Course book,August,"Comprehensive and long Python Crash Course book. It's good for me but then I'm an experienced programmer and administration. I think it would be OK for a real beginning programmer too, but working through a book by rote is not going to really prepare them to be a good programmer. They'll learn python though."
Diana Rojas,5.0,Very interesting book,November,I learned alot from every page of this book
JManInPhoenix,5.0,Excellent intro into Python,August,About halfway through the book now - in the middle of the alien invasion project.  Book is very well written - it explains all the basics with just enough detail to understand but not overboard with too much.  I recommend getting both the hard copy and e copy of the book as I found the e copy to be very helpful to look at when I have Visual Studio Code open and working on a file.
Chris,5.0,This book is great,May,"I'm learning so much from this book. It's slow going because I don't have as much time to spend on it as I'd like, but it walks me step by step when I do have a few spare minutes to learn code."
Ned Givens,5.0,Great instruction for learning Python,March,Read and learn Python as I am studying Data Analytics. Have my newly bought Samsung tablet next to my laptop to work the examples. I am very pleased with this book. I highly recommend it.
RA Wolfe,5.0,Great Refresher too,August,I bought this because I had stopped paying attention to python before version 3 and so was rusty.
Ryan,5.0,Easy to Follow,August,"The bad first; I had to get a replacement book. NOT because of shipping issues, because the back cover was smaller than the pages. The pages overlapped the back cover and the pages were getting hit on every surface I sat the book on. The replacement came in and it's beat up as well, which could have been shipping. At least the pages are fine. Since that's not the content I can't take away stars for a quality assurance issue."
Amazonian,5.0,"Five Stars for content, Zero for Binding",August,"Outstanding book that's well laid-out and absolutely perfect for learning or brushing up on Python.  The binding, however, is awful.  After only a couple of days of reading, the binding has completely separated from the spine (see photo).  So while the quality of the content is first class, the binding is strictly economy.  Fortunately, the paperback is only 17 bucks.  Much more than that and I would have requested a replacement."
Mr.Martin,4.0,Crash Course,May,Purchased these book for my boy to get self knowledge  on the pc technology and beyond
Thomas Veach,5.0,Learn Python.,July,Very well edited for ease of use. Text is easily read. Good feedback lessons to allow the user to test learning.
Youness Alqoh,5.0,Very helpful,November,Very helpful and its very famous book
Eric J.,5.0,Very nice book!,May,"This review is for the printed version of the book; I have not seen the kindle version.  I am an experienced developer, but brand new to Python.  After buying, and in one case returning, several kindle books on Python, I still hadn’t found one which I felt did a first-rate job of presenting the material.  Then I bought the “Python Crash Course” book.  I’m only on Page 130, but so far the book has exceeded my expectations."
Ariyo Omolade,5.0,The Book that hand-held me into programming,September,"This book took me fron ground zero to a more knowledgeable python programmer. I learnt pretty much alot about working with file, data visualization, classes, methods, functions ect. I highly recommend this book as the first book to study when venturing into python programming. Thought the quality of binding of the book needs to be worked because after rigorous reading the book falls apart. But is a must read for any beginner."
Shahzad Khan,5.0,A good refresher,October,I like it end to end
Gouthami,3.0,Good book to start but not who want to become a gem in python,July,Good book to start the python course but needed more detailed explination. The assiagnment given as try it yourself is good way to learn but how can i know iam i doing the right or wrong the answer should given back of the book so we can learn easily.
Amazon Customer,5.0,great book,December,excellent material arrived quickly!
Louis,5.0,Super helpful!,April,I learned c++ in college but didn’t practice any after. I recently got back into coding and wanted to learn python...great language to start with. This book is the best book you can buy to learn python. The flow is great. The mini assignments build off each other. I’m constantly going back to the assignments to practice and I try to complete them in a different way each time. Buy this book.
Tekdif,5.0,Practical application,July,"I purchased this book and prime delivered as they always do in 24 hours since it was a small item and ""in stock"""
Amazon Customer,5.0,Easy to use,September,I use it as a reference or as continuous reading.  It's a lot of pages but it's not too heavy to read.
Vittorio A.,5.0,,December,I've almost never studied informatic nor code language and this book is a fantastic starter. It explains you everything and you can follow step by step every explanation because you try to code everyting you learn. Very good and after the first section of the book there's a second one that goes deep in coding and explain to you more complex stuff and even create your own game or other complex tasks.
Parveen Parveen,5.0,,December,Very good book
Abhinav,5.0,,January,"This is the best book to learn python for beginners. For best results, study a topic daily and practice the TRY YOURSELF exercises twice"
Amazon Customer,5.0,,December,Informative book
Ibrahim,4.0,,October,"Learning programming is hard alone but trying to learn programming from reading is a pain far from imagination. Fortunately this life saver was very easy to understand and beginner friendly, however the write had one downfall he failed to provide alternatives for windows users in the command line"
Amazon Customer,5.0,,November,"A good book for providing an introduction to Python with some useful exercises. I have gone on to purchase further books by the author, who also has a course on Udemy. valuable"
Paul Westeneng,5.0,,October,About 30-40 years ago I was a C programmer and did a lot of other things since.
Dave,4.0,,June,Still getting into Python - using several online sources  and books.
Amazon Kunde,5.0,,October,Best Python book for beginners! + Python Distilled is needed
Tom,5.0,,September,"Easy to follow, everything explained in perfect detail. Definitely a great starting point if you are just getting into coding. Book sets you up with alot of knowledge and you can definitely start building small yet meaningful projects upon completion."
Calgary maman,5.0,,November,Great starter book if you're tackling Python with little coding experience.  Only blip is the cover unglues from the book. I'd trialled a copy from my local library first and same problem. The problem isn't with Amazon.
Trajano Bertrand Llera Romero,5.0,,October,Vary easy to learn Python language with this book. I love it
Kristian Martin,5.0,,September,This book is great if you have no previous coding experience.
J SIMPSON,5.0,,May,I like the format (specific lines given numbers so detailed explanations of each part can be explained clearly and simply ) and the no nonsense dive into each aspect is in useful. Not only does it give you lots of examples and exercises to do at every stage but (I'm only 50% through it yet) the examples also include typical mistakes so you learn what to look out for. Which is invaluable to a python programmer just starting out.
Giorgos,4.0,,July,"As suggested by the ""crash course"" title will get you started fast in comparison to others and it will do it quite methodically. You will not go deep or in detail and the examples and exercises are on the easy side."
MR. D. S. P. TUSON,5.0,,June,"This is well written, presents the information in an easily readable and comprehensible style, and covers a range of material that is broad enough to provide a good foundation to start tackling practical tasks. As with any book aimed at this level, it will bring the user (you need to do the coding of course, and not just read the words) to a fair level of independent capability, so that with a mindset of being willing to carry on working out how you do things with Python, you would be ready to build your experience without too much of a struggle. I recommend this book highly."
Bijay shaw,4.0,,July,Very good book for beginners...
Sebastián,5.0,,July,"Llevo años queriendo aprender Python y al fin decidí comprar este libro para tener una guía más estable a la hora de aprender. Se cubren conceptos básicos de programación, aparte de que la forma en la que se enseñan el lenguaje es rápida pero concisa, de modo que pasas por muchos temas rápidamente pero comprendiendolos gracias a las excelentes explicaciones. El tamaño del libro es perfecto para leerse con facilidad en un escritorio junto a una computadora, a esto se le suma que la tipografía es muy fácil de leer."
DBarnett,5.0,,August,"This book is an ideal introduction to Python. It sets out important concepts in a logical manner, and explains the details very clearly. While I haven't got to the three projects yet, I can certainly recommend the 'Basics' section that covers the building blocks of the language."
Gabriela Mendes,4.0,,May,"Eu já tenho conhecimento em programação, porém pela linguagem do livro e a forma como ele introduz os conceitos parece que demonstra que seu público alvo é para iniciantes em programação, então acredito que qualquer pessoa consiga seguir todos os capítulos do livro se seguir passo a passo."
Joseph,5.0,,April,I'm just blown away by how easy to digest this book is. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is looking to learn python.
Purna Ghosh,4.0,,February,One of the best book for beginners.The 1st part of the book is really really good.Most of the basics is well explained with lots of examples.
Robert Broadbent,3.0,,November,BTW = The person for whom I bought this is me -  83 yo - so unless I have regressed faster than I thought ;-)  next question hardly applicable.
Marlino Cano,5.0,,July,"This is the best book that I have used to learn Python. I tried first some online coursed but, in my case, I needed something more basic and didactic. This book is great to learn from scratch and allows you to have a good foundation to learn more and specialized if you want to. I highly recommend it."
Stephen,5.0,,May,I wanted to try programming again but had been put off by trying to learn VBA at university and not really undertstanding it at all. Python seems to be much easier to learn and this book is very well written. I'm only part way through but already feeling confident and interested to learn more.
Charles,5.0,,January,"I read this book cover to cover over a weekend and went from being a complete Python beginner to a someone advanced enough to pretty much do whatever I want with the language.  Granted, I've been programming for around 40 years now in dozens of different languages, so I was able to get through chapters quickly, taking notes on the differences between Python and other languages I knew.  But it really covers everything you need to know, from the basics all the way up to game programming data visualizing, and even building websites with Python.  So just sweep all the other Python books off your shelf and put this one in it's place. It's all you need."
Federico,5.0,,March,"Dopo aver visionato diversi testi, sia in inglese che in italiano, ho finalmente trovato il giusto testo per un ripasso e soprattutto per un approfondimento di Python."
marsha,5.0,,September,N/A
Jason,5.0,,February,"I have to say, after taking many different courses on python programming (both online and in university) this is by far the best value and most comprehensive approach. Everything is taught in a clear and concise manner with opportunities to practice what has been taught while explaining the rationale and logic behind each concept."
Apo,5.0,,August,"C'est un excellent ouvrage pour qui veut découvrir la programmation en Python, voire la programmation tout court. L'anglais utilisé est très accessible et le style agréable. On est mis dans le bain très vite mais tous les détails sont minutieusement expliqués Ces explications pourront parfois sembler longuettes au lecteur, mais il peut aisément choisir de les passer. En revanche il est clair que quelqu'un qui a un niveau intermédiaire (ou ""pis"", confirmé) en Python n'en tirera que peu de bénéfices."
Carlos FL,5.0,,June,"Ideal para aprender y comenzar a profundizar, clamarente explicado con tips a lo largo del libro"
Lynnzal,1.0,,December,"As a beginner I have attempted a couple of times to get my head around Python and thought this could be the book to push me over the initial hurdles.  I have used Spyder (Python3.7) software without issue. However, I am struggling to get the recommended by author Sublime Text software to work with Python3.  It is perhaps the least intuitive set up I have come across. The recommended troubleshooting points to the books website companion, but this is unavailable if you didn't purchase the book via the website."
Hollow Ground,4.0,,April,"I've been doing some work with Python, but wanted to make sure I fully understand the basics and things one can do with Python aside from data analysis."
Joe Ganch,4.0,,June,"I'm told this is the number one seller for Python books. I'm not surprised. I got a 1 st Ed copy from my library so I decided to invest in this, the 2 nd. ed. I bought my copy to help me through a course on Django as it's one of the only intro books out there that covers it and it does it well. There are a few hiccups in the directions for setting that up, but I managed to get around them. Stuff like activating the virtual environment. My only disappointment and it nearly knocked the book down to 3 stars is man oh man are they ever making books cheaply now. The covers are paper thin and you can almost see through the pages. Just corporate greed all the time. Disgusting really."
Gwen,5.0,,July,"My son love it, and I saw that it has good quality and prints very well. I think that the book has great knowledge for the python lover."
Cliente Amazon,4.0,,April,"Clases, colecciones, diccionarios, aplicaciones web"
Cetinszn,5.0,,November,"I've mainly purchased this book to have a good source in details but it's more suitable for beginners. I haven't experienced any problems about the print quality, unlike other comments I'm very happy that there isn't any coloured text or black background code snippets. I found more beneficial to take your own notes or highlight manually the parts you had practised. It's easier to look back and find your notes on the book. Otherwise it's not different than reading people's snippets on stackoverflow.  Paper quality is good. Nothing to complain but I wish I had chance have a sneak peek to know the level of information. If you just started to learn python this book is great for you. But if you already finished a beginner python course or watch CS50 week 6 on YouTube, you don't need this book for learning. But you can benefit the projects part. I also purchased O'Reilly python cookbook from Amazon and if you need advanced information to solve complex problems you should check them too."
Darijo,5.0,,April,"This book is a masterpiece. I will recommend it to anyone. Literally a masterpiece. I've read hundreds of articles about Python, numerous tutorials, video tutorials, books also. Most of them were crap, but this is space ship. I'll buy next edition for sure."
Kailas,5.0,,June,I received book in good condition that too within two days. Very happy with the purchase.
Patrick,5.0,,June,Well composed book with excellent problems and projects.
Romuald Čaplinskij,5.0,,June,Great book for beginers. All wrote in easy to understand terms.
Antonio Carlos,5.0,,October,"Ótima porta de entrada, e referência de consulta permanente às estruturas básicas da linguagem. Não que seja perfeito, mas"
ELHAM Honarvar,5.0,,June,good book for beginners in python
Mr. Michael Gover,5.0,,August,"This could be used by a complete beginner to coding, in which case it's worth working carefully through all the examples.  It holds your hand as you work through the basics.  It then moves on to projects, data visualisation, and web applications.  If you have some programming experience you might feel able to skip bits.  You will really want to use a text editor like Sublime.  Theoretically this is is free but constant reminders will drive you nuts so you will end up spending £50 buying it (but it IS excellent)."
Spaniasc,5.0,,January,"By far the most amazing book I have read up until now. Half of the book goes over the fundamental concepts that everyone must be aware of, and on the other half you get the chance to implement all the acquired knowledge to three amazing projects."
Oscar,5.0,,December,El libro está muy bien escrito y no utiliza una terminología demasiado compleja ni un lenguaje muy técnico; todos los conceptos técnicos que se utilizan con frecuencia en el libro son explicados previamente.
R. S. Boyce,4.0,,December,Bought for my son who is a technician
JeffB,4.0,,November,"I am fairly new to Python and am  about 30 % through this book.  This first part of the book deals almost entirely with the programming language.  Lots of examples of code are given and exercises to do throughout each chapter.  By and large, I am able to follow along with most of it, with a few bumps along the road when new concepts are introduced.  I haven't read in this book much about the way Python deals with files on the computer and the online code resources that are available, so am hoping that the book discusses these in subsequent chapters.  May get back to update this review later.  This book seems suitable for a older teen/adult."
Katherine Szewczyk,5.0,,April,Just getting into programming and this book is literally everything .. I'm only a couple of months in and I can write a game now - that's crazy.
Cerulean,5.0,,January,"I did an online course but there weren't enough practical exercises so I thought this might help. I was so right! Wish I'd bought this first and not bothered with the course at all, it's much better and you can practice everything at your own pace."
Bilal A. Hasan,4.0,,June,"The contents are organized into two parts: Part one goes through the language constructs, functions, classes, etc.; while part two walks one through three very different projects. If you're already familiar with object oriented programming and want to learn a new language, python in this case, then you may find this book somewhat verbose. But that just means you can skim over some or more of the text per your level of familiarity. I decided to spend some time on the last of the three projects, Web Applications: This one uses the Django framework, which is great in that you can make a professional looking site fairly easily; but it is also a bit distracting in that there's less about the python language in this project and more about the Django framework constructs. Anyhow, that's likely a subjective view. All-in-all, it is a very nice book to learn the python language, and use it a few different ways."
Akash KANTETI,4.0,,July,"First of all,the Pro's"
JOSE ANTONIO GARCIA,5.0,,July,Lo recomiendo...
Pit Gutzmann,5.0,,August,"A huuuuuuge compliment to the author of this book! I have never seen such a great book when it comes to teaching programming languages. It starts with simple things like printing something onto the screen, then tells you about variables, comparisons, lists, for-loops, conditions and so on, always building up on the simple things. Each and every concept is shown in small programm snippets that are first shown as programm listing, then explained in detail, and then the output is shown. What I REALLY like about the didactics in this book is that the author also shows common errors when using the commands/methods he just showed us, how to spot those errors, how to provoke them to understand what is going on and how to correct them. He also now and then encourages the reader to think about projects he might want to do later on. I downloaded a Python editor onto my cellphone and test things as I read them. It's real fun to learn Python this way!"
Lucy,5.0,,March,"The binding makes the book hard to read, to hold (I have very small hands)"
Jeremy W,5.0,,February,Great book. Well written. Feels just like being back in class with a great teacher.
King97,5.0,,December,This book lays all the basics of Python programming in a very simple and well organized way so that anyone new to this language can learn it and have fun with it at the same time. Would recommend it to any beginner in programming.
Nilesh rai,4.0,,March,Worth every penny for beginners. Ever thing is written in detail you don't need any video lectures after reading this book you can solve problems and write a code easily.
meatball,5.0,,January,"I tried out many video tutorials for learning Python. Youtube videos are nice, but at one stage you might be lost your motivation for learning. Now I start learning from this book, the true thing is that It's really nice, especially it takes you in the right way, guides you with some easy and tricky exercises. Also, there are three projects that have really a nice start for your own project. I recommended all of the new and freaser. School kids can also take it as a good resource. Happy cooding"
Paul,5.0,,February,"Easy to follow, great ""hands on"" activities, real world references. A fantastic overview of all aspects of Python development, design and implementation."
CED1,4.0,,October,Je ne suis qu’au début de l’apprentissage mais ce livre m’a l’air très intéressant.
Amazon Customer,4.0,,October,Publisher needs to take a second look at d cover page binding my copy is less than  2 months old  and its has  started ripping of however my overall perspective about this book is that its content is concise  comprehensive  and simple to grasp concepts has been really useful and helpful for me personally as a novice programmer and will highly recommend this book for new starters in programming
Amazon Customer,4.0,,July,Been having fun working my way through this book. Feels like I'm picking up on things relatively quick due to the format. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to learn python.
T.A.M,5.0,,April,"Well, my background in programming is “nothing” I can say it’s like an English speaker with no prior experience learning Russian. This book makes it very simple and easy for a beginner like me. I love it. It’s an excellent resource."
Genaro,5.0,,July,"Good book to start with Python. The book helped me to start and understand the basic concepts. It is a start course, if you aim to continue working with python in professional projects, you will require some additional literature that goes beyond the basics and treats some topics like testing, visibility of attributes, patterns etc."
Deviprasad,5.0,,March,If you want to make your basics strong then just go for this book. It is a bit costly but really easy to understand
Stanley Zhang,5.0,,May,
Eric Millington,5.0,,February,"Python is a pretty easy language to get going with and this book 'holds your hand' very well.As you work through the 'try it yourself' sections you will find yourself thinking ""I've already done this before"" but that's ok because it's just reinforcing your understanding, by the end of chapter 4 you'll be creating your own 'lists' of data in their millions, slicing them up, pulling individual elements out, cycling through your lists using 'for' loops, formatting your output using 'F' strings etc etc, and you'll be able to code these things without opening the book as a reference!  I know there's a lot of book left for me to work through but I'm super confident I'll be fine with it!"
Grace,5.0,,May,"I absolutely love this book! Was recommended to me by a friend. I before beginning it I took the python 3 course on code academy. However, I still had a million and 1 questions! But the moment I used this book all my questions were answered, and more. I now have a great foundation with which I can go on to learn more advanced techniques. So, it's a 10/10 for me."
Ervinas,5.0,,December,"Starting in Python was very easy thankful to this book. It has helped me understand what variables are, strings, classes etc."
Paul Ambler,5.0,,January,"This book is well presented, and provides detailed information about each example.  There are a lot of opportunities to try out what you just learned throughout.  This is the best Python book I have read so far.  If your not sure its right for you, download a free kindle sample, it gives you the first 3 full chapters.  I did that, and ended up buying the book once I had finished the second chapter."
M. Anstey,5.0,,December,Really excellent book. The text is extremely well written and the practical projects really bring it all together. This is how all introductory programming books should be written.
Gfanal,4.0,,September,"Les premiers chapitres sont vraiment ce qu'on attend d'une bonne initiation à un langage... puis ça se gâte un peu. L'auteur passe trop tôt à des exemples élaborés et souvent obscurs, égrenant en cours de route des explications et des éclaircissements qu'on aurait bien préféré trouver dans des chapitres spécifiques – notamment sur l'identification et la compréhension des librairies et des modules spécifiques à diverses utilisations."
Rpc,5.0,,September,"En su primera mitad es un libro adecuado para iniciarse en Python. Si lo complementáis con las flash cards del mismo autor, es material suficiente para comprender los fundamentos de Python. En la segunda parte podéis programar un videojuego de marcianitos."
Amazon Customer,5.0,,November,"Did my research before buying and glad I landed on this book. Of all the beginner level materials I've read on Python, I had the easiest time absorbing and staying focused on this (that's including the textbooks for my CS degree). I can see though, as other reviewers have said, that the spine isn't very well joined to the pages - however, I'm going to be very careful with it and maybe I'll be lucky with my copy."
Homer23,5.0,,November,"This is an absolute must  read for complete beginners, it assumes reader has no programming background and would teach everything from the basics. The best part is that there are three projects that would help you cement whatever one learns in the chapters. Easy to read with  proper explanation of technical Jargon."
Karan kumar,5.0,,April,Good for beginners.
pbeth,5.0,,February,"Si estás empezando a programar o quieres iniciarte en el mundo de Python, comenzar con este libro es una de las mejores opciones. El libro abarca  todos los conceptos básicos con abundantes ejemplos, donde se pueden adquirir y afianzar las bases del lenguaje, además, propone una serie de proyectos que permiten ahondar en determinadas herramientas y librerías que ofrece el lenguaje, aunque sea de manera bastante superficial, no obstante, como toma de contacto está más que bien."
Thomas Mccann,5.0,,December,"Great book for anybody studying python or needing a refresher, full of useful information and examples of code in a very well structured format."
Wesam,4.0,,March,i like the book
José DR,5.0,,March,Es un buen libro para los que comenzamos en el mundo de la programación.
Tim,5.0,,October,I didn't know where to start to begin to learn to code and was recommended this book. The first half covers all the critical basic principles of python and then runs through applying these techniques in three projects - definitely recommend.
siddharth tripathi,5.0,,September,Absolutely new to programming world... hence only giving review on quality of book I received today. It's very good and its 2nd edition which I wanted and initial few pages read told me its examples are for python version 3.6 and above while few classics are carried forward from ver 2 as well which still works.... so far so good...will revise my rating and comments after 2 months to give better idea to new programmers like me.
AnaVK,1.0,,July,"Started to read the book, and it seems very interesting, BUT one problem! A chapter or two in I started to notice these little brown bugs crawling around on the pages."
Madhusoodanan.M.K,5.0,,March,"I recently bought a copy of the book, this is the best book on python I have ever read. I have read books like Core Python Programming, Head First Python, Python the Hard way etc. But if you are a beginner in python I recommend you buy this book, Python crash course by Eric Matthes, and excellent book."
Kalyankumar Ramaseshan,5.0,,April,A couple of decades experienced Java developer here trying to learn Python. I picked up the right book to get started with Python and it didn't disappoint me with the expectation for me to quickly getting started with Python. I wish every programming language has this kind of book. Finally a python book for all!
Matt,4.0,,June,I’m a software engineer and need to learn python for my job. I prefer books and this is a rather good book. Bought this in conjunction with another Python book and was writing basic programs in the language by the end of the first day. Very good book for those needing to learn Python.
Snehal  Balghare,5.0,,February,"This book is very good for learning python when you are new to Language. This book language is very simple and understandable. In the 1st half you can find all basic programming basic like looping, list , classes etc. and in the second section you can find projects. I will recommend this book to everyone who start to learn python."
Amazon Customer,5.0,,August,This is a must have if you are like me and know nothing about the programming. It is a good read with plenty explanation and examples. I highly recommend it.
Abdullah Jirjees,5.0,,February,"Very nice book, I loved it."
Amazon Customer,5.0,,October,This book took me from knowing nothing to being able to do many wonderful things with python. Great place to start if your new to python or coding in general!
Marco C.,5.0,,August,"Avendo già una conoscenza base di altri linguaggi di programmazione, è facile seguire il testo e imparare i fondamenti di python. L’approccio è didattico, chiaro, ricco di esempi e spiegazioni precise di ciascuna riga di codice. Consiglio soprattutto a chi preferisce imparare python in autonomia."
D S Macqueen,5.0,,May,One of the best programming books I have come across in 50 years! A non-programmer would find this book very easy to follow.
Manuel Cabusas Jr,5.0,,January,Totally nice and perfect. I bought this as a gift for my son who’s contemplating if programming could be his liking before venturing university.
jorge,5.0,,April,"El libro esta apuntado a principiantes, que nunca programaron en su vida y es una forma bastante amigable de empezar a introducirte, como tal es muy claro y facil de entender obviamente si piensas dedicarte a esto tendras que complementarlo con mas libros y bibliografia, pero como base es muy solido"
Ben,5.0,,June,"A very well written book with good code examples, relatable explanations and some great exercises. This book will help you get started and it also becomes a great reference book to return to when you need a refresh or a reminder."
luke,5.0,,May,"I have been working through this book, during the covid lockdown, and it is written in an easy to understand manor. I would, and have, highly recommend it! I am planning on purchasing further books in the future."
NorthernSage,5.0,,May,"This is one of the better Python books I have read, its well paced and clear in it's wording. I bought it on the kindle .  I can go back to it at any point and use it as a reference guide as my skills developed."
Mr. Steven T. Hawkins,5.0,,June,"Up to Chapter 5 so far and loving working through the book. Well written, clear and concise. Just enough information to assist in learning, but not too much to overload you. As a complete programming beginner I'm really enjoying the book."
VIKU,1.0,,November,Pirated copy received
L.A,5.0,,May,It was my first Python book. I followed the topics in order and read whole book and did the projects. Very good book for beginners. It explains the topics clearly and builds new concepts on top of what was learnt in previous topics.
Manuel,5.0,,June,"El libro explica muy bien cada uno de los temas que propone, te guía y explica paso a paso/línea por línea de código."
euthyphro.,4.0,,May,Content: This is a straightforward and accessible introduction to Python which will quickly get you creating your own programmes
J Bickerton,5.0,,August,I've wanted to learn python for a while to support my data analysis work and a friend recommended this book. I've really enjoyed working through it and I have found that even the more complicated concepts are explained in a way which is easy to follow. I'd highly recommend it for anyone just starting out with python.
WiLdAnGeeL,5.0,,December,Som jag hoppas min dotter blir glad för i julklapp.
Johnny B,5.0,,June,"This book offers a great introduction to Python, from Hello World to making your own Space Invaders game. The teaching style is patient and informative."
Brian G. Mc Enery,5.0,,February,"This is a really great book. A great introduction to Python for all levels of previous programming experience. Examples and exercises are really thought out well, and they develop your Python skills at a steady pace. I would recommend this book for everyone."
George Jr,5.0,,June,Want to pick up python in a week?  Want to remember and produce python programs? I picked up python with just this book within a week. Don’t waste your time on online courses without practice. This is the best book on earth now.
Tom M.,5.0,,October,"I have tried other resources such as ""learn python the hard way"" and although it is a good book, this book just seems to flow better and has a great layout. I'm new to programming and out of all the resources I've procured this book is by far the best"
graemebg,2.0,,October,I did not find the kindle version helpful for my task. I am a beginner and over the years I have bought two raspberry pi’s but neither worked. I have an astronomical telescope and wanted to photograph through the eyepiece. I bought a pi 4 and camera module and the pi book on photography and Bingo it gave me the start I needed. The Noobs SD card bright the other pi’s to life. So following the programming in the Raspberry Pi for Beginners book  fired the inspiration. I can now take photographs with the Pi 4 and 3b. I am sure one day the crash course may be helpful. But if you are like me don’t buy it without a project. The Linux language andPython are no goes  on their own.
Sherman,5.0,,April,This was exactly what I was looking for. I'm very new to programming and this book really great for learning to language overall.
Amazon Customer,5.0,,June,Fantastic book especially for begginers. Just stick with it and it'll steer you in the right direction!
Martin Yanchev,5.0,,February,The book contains all the information you need to really grasp the very basics of programming. It also contains 3 really helpful projects. The code inside the book is easily readable and I didn't have any difficulties while reading it.
Nandu,3.0,,August,The bad. The book has bad binding on his cover.  Surprised that happens. There is a disclaimer at the end. That explained about the poor services from the manufacturer.
Daniel Patterson,3.0,,May,"Turns out this is a direct copy from a website. The quality of the book, paper is poor, thin."
Patrick,5.0,,April,Der Aufbau des Buchs macht es jedem Einsteiger einfach die Grundlagen in Python zu verstehen. Die praktischen Beispiele bieten die notwendigen Übungen und ergänzen den theoretischen Teil hervorragend.
Frank,5.0,,March,I can't think of a better book for beginners than this book. It literally take your hand and starts with small steps and takes you deep into excersizes and projects that would build on your knowledge.
Alexy Gendron,4.0,,August,Really good for learning the basics if you are a beginner
Goran,4.0,,October,"Good book, written in a simple and understandable language. I have some programming background so first chapters are a fairly simple, but this is book for beginners and this is good."
Amazon Customer,5.0,,September,Es muy practico y va al punto

Jean Clume,5.0,,January,Ce livre est une merveille didactique pour quiconque se lance dans ce langage.
Reader,2.0,,October,Earlier I gave the 4 Star but after reading to the deep of this book.... I found UNEXCEPTABLE SYNTAX error  in Chapter 9 that describing the important topic CLASSES! So most of the chapter 9 are full of mistake and unable to run the code! Very very frustrating. Amazon and the writer of this book should give us the answer for this.
Ainars,5.0,,July,"Thank you for a book, take care"
Mazen AOUNALLAH,5.0,,January,"This is really the book to read if you are starting programming, not only python. The code is clearly written and explained."
Amazon Customer,1.0,,June,A growing trend affecting books purchased from Amazon is the fact they are 'Print On Demand' and are very poor quality.
Deepanshu,5.0,,August,This book is for those who want to start learning python.
Dilshad Mustafa,5.0,,September,This book is literally amazing. The book I got is original and the print quality is so so good that it can't be described in words and the content quality is also great because of it's easily understandable language.
Leon Hill,5.0,,February,Helped me improve my skills as a python programmer! I would greatly recommend this book to anyone who is a newbie at programming.
Alex,4.0,,February,"NO CABE DUDA QUE EL  LIBRO OFERTADO, CUMPLEN CON LAS ESPECTATIVAS DE LOS CLIENTES MAS EXIJENTES, UN SERVICIO Y ATENCIÓN SIN DUDA MUY BUENA"
Tobias,5.0,,May,I have tried many times to learn Python and always struggled with the learning material. This one is the most clearly explained I have found. Very detailed and beginner friendly with material about Object Oriented Programming. Lots of exercises with various difficulty levels.
RKH,4.0,,December,"It seems not original USA print. So, price bit high."
Applestrain,5.0,,November,"Mein Mann, der gerade Python lernt, findet es super, dass er sofort mit einem Spiel anfangen kann. Viel lustiger so zu lernen als linear und ohne Ziel."

sanjay c.,5.0,,December,"Book's content is very good but there is a problem in binding, when you open the book it always get closed, you have to put something to stop."
Si,2.0,,July,"None of the ""Try it yourself"" exercises have answers so if you get stuck, that's it really. The author's advice to ""take 5 minutes and have a think about it"" or ""go on the Python forum"" is not helpful. I work on an IT helpdesk and if that was how I assisted my customers, I'd soon be out of a job."
rohit wadhwani,4.0,,December,Learning a lot from book
Godot,2.0,,March,"En même temps que les principes de base du Python sont expliqués, l'auteur entre trop dans les détails au lieu d'y revenir plus tard. Par exemple pour le chapitre sur comment utiliser les listes, il va passer du temps pour expliquer le résultat en indentant le code dans la boucle, avant la boucle, après la boucle, pleins de fonctionalités sur les listes, on s'y perd sans même avoir encore abordé les conditions du chapitre suivant."
Ramiz,5.0,,September,"This is an excellent book, you should definitely buy this book if you are a beginner or a python expert. This book has multiple projects that make this book value for money"
Devesh Gupta,5.0,,July,Very nice book. Best book to learn python.

Chicco,5.0,,November,Ce lit bien et permet d'expérimenté
Cliente Amazon,3.0,,August,"Per il libro in sé sarebbero 5 stelle senza ombra di dubbio, ottimo sia per chi è alle prime armi e non ha mai programmato, sia per chi arriva da altri linguaggi e vuole imparare velocemente la sintassi di Python. La qualità della copertina del libro però è pessima, la mia si è scollata dopo aver letto neppure 2 capitoli."

Howar Stugard,5.0,,July,Item was as advertised.
lucine,4.0,,January,"Maybe print on demand. Print is slightly blurry, definitely not sharp clear."
Philippe Buschini,4.0,,March,"Un peu fourre-tout, mais parfaitement adapté à quelqu’un qui souhaiterait apprendre le python (à condition d’en avoir déjà quelques notions et surtout de lire l’anhlais)."
LT,5.0,,December,Gifted
King Larry,2.0,,April,"I bought this book to learn python based on the 4000+ reviews which are mainly positive, but my copy had a poor print quality from the start and the content is now out of date. Although this book is clearly one of the best sellers, newer books with a better print quality and more up to date content have been released at similar prices."
goodchap,5.0,,April,Amazing book for learning Python!
