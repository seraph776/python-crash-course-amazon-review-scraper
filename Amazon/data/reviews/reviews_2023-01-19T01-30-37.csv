Luis Garcia,5.0,Hand down best Python book for beginners!,"January,15,,2023","This book gave me functional Python3 knowledge after about a month of studying and following along. I’ve not yet finished the projects but look forward to doing so. The author is great at explaining concepts and does it in a very well thought out order. The practice problems are just independent enough to be challenging and it does not at all feel like your hand is being held the whole time. Be advised, there is a 3rd edition of this book out now. Not much of a difference but this is not the latest edition anymore."
michael niosi,5.0,"Amazing book, but I didnt know the 3rd edition was just released...","January,16,,2023","I only finished the first section so far, but I love this book enough to leave a five star review. It explains all concepts simply, but with just enough details to not overload you. Hope im not missing out on much by purchasing the 2nd edition and not the 3rd."
bri,5.0,Great Book!,"January,10,,2023","I have already done some learning on python through some online courses, and this book is an amazing supplement that even went into better detail then my online class! Can’t recommend it enough. This book will really help you. It is very easy and simple to follow."
D. Siddall,5.0,Best Python Intro Ever,"January,2,,2023","I’ve approached python several times, with varying levels of commitment. This is the first text I’ve encountered that threads the needle between being comprehensive and approachable. I’ve been completely absorbed for over a week, and am getting excited about testing out what I’ve learned with some more advanced books in the No Starch series. Highly recommended!"
sri,5.0,Good book for the beginners,"January,8,,2023","I like the simplicity of the text and explanation of the author to understand easily. The other free sources like pdf, cheat sheet and much more resources which were provided in the website are very useful."
G. W.,5.0,"Recommend getting, but also get proof of Python knowledge elsewhere (see below)","December,26,,2021","So far I've only made it to ""for loops"" chapter 4; but I think this is a really good book. I had an online class from a local University and this book has covered somethings that the class did not. Not that what the book covered and the class didn't has been major; but is interesting that only having reached chapter 4 in the book that there are things the class left out. So far the biggest change between this book and the class I took is that the book does a much better job of explaining for loops. I even watched a video on Youtube to teach you Python with no experience and even that did not do as good a job of explaining why a for loop is written the way it is. Being that the class I took was online and was one of those classes done in half the time (warp speed) I didn't bother to ask why a for loop is written the way it is I just wrote it and followed the class examples (and yes I passed the class with an A but Python is not my first programming language). I feel way more confident in learning Python after the book did such a good job of explaining for loops that as I continue with the book I believe it will explain things better then the class I took or the video I watched. On a side note the class I took, as all college classes I have taken do, required a book and that book just didn't do a good job of explaining for loops (go figure). You might be wondering why am I using this book if I took an online class and the answer is it has been awhile since I took that class so I need a refresher. Also the college that I took that class from doesn't offer another a following Python class to take unless you sign up for a degree program (and I already have a degree I just want to become proficient in Python). I would recommend that if you want to learn Python to use in a job to take at least one class from a college or another way to get proof that you learned Python other than studying it on your own. Also another reason to learn from a book with no class attached to it is you can learn at your own pace. Now I could learn from the book that I bought for the college course since the class only went so far into the book; but I just didn't find that book to be very well written and full of information one doesn't really need to learn how to program with Python. I feel like a ""college"" course book has a lot of bloat while a book like this one is more straight forward. A book like this one survives and sells or not because it is good etc while a college course book is chosen by the teacher or school regardless of the reviews it got. So after this extremely long review I would recommend this book; but I think one does need something (a class, certificate etc) to show proof that one has at least some Python knowledge outside of ones own studying."
Diana,5.0,Buy it! Thank you PCC!,"October,22,,2022","Bought this book (actual paper copy and no I didn't have any issues with the binding) in July to prepare for an intro to python course for school that started in Aug. I got through the book in about 6 weeks (balancing work and personal life) and it is totally do-able. This book prepared me for the basics that were covered in class and allowed me to think outside the box when it came to discussions. The book truly gave me the confidence that I believe I would have not had otherwise. You do not need to know any fancy terminology or have ANY idea on how to create a programming environment. The book guides you through the entire process (creating a programming environment, downloading packages, etc)  and you can find the solutions to the problems online, the author gives you the URL to the github site so you can check your work. There is an online Python subreddit that the author checks and will respond to your PCC questions as well.,$20 or so dollars, totally worth it!"
Paul,5.0,Excellent book,"December,20,,2022","I learned a lot about python from this book. The author clearly explained each topic, followed by real-life examples."
Jason Zheng,5.0,Amazing Beginner friendly introduction to Python,"December,3,,2022",Terrific start in learning python. Many concepts are easy to understand with no need of previous knowlege needed. Only knock on it is that some explanations didn’t go into too much detail so I had to search it up on google to understand. Other than that great book!
Amazon Customer,4.0,Thank you,"December,19,,2022",I like it thx
Duey2000,5.0,Great book!,"November,15,,2022",I got this book to compliment a class that I was taking and it was a great companion. It’s easy to follow for somebody with little to zero coding experience and it offers easy to follow exercises along the way to help you catch on to the fundamentals. I would recommend this to anybody starting out in Python. I plan on getting more from the series.
James,5.0,"Great book, easy to learn","December,8,,2022",I really like this book and it's nice vs learning everything through online tutorials.
LoveyDovey,5.0,I have to give you your five stars,"November,20,,2022",I am as beginner level as you can be and this book has propelled me in my Python journey.
Chris Paschen,4.0,"Great, but don't try to CRAM the Crash Course","July,10,,2022","This book was great. We used it for a 1 semester intro to programming course with high school students.,The only issue was that I tried to cram both the main content and one of the extra projects at the end all into one semester, which was too much.,There are a couple chapters that cover more than one topic that really should be broken up into individual weeks.,We're still going to use the book, but do it over an entire year, and use some supplemental No Starch Press Python books to fill the extra weeks.,NOTE: The one area that this book doesn't cover is creating GUI interfaces. So we will use other sources for that at the end of this book in the future.,ALSO: Student all had VERY strong praise for this book. Well written and well designed."
Zerono,5.0,Tips for beginners,"February,16,,2022","Wanted to add in a few tips, so beginners don't get discouraged. Just started reading this book yesterday, and immediately I ran into an issue with getting Sublime Text to work properly. If you're having the same problem, here's what's going wrong. On page 9, the author mentions that you can skip the part that says to create a ""New Build System"" if Python 3 is running correctly. If you were like me and you did not skip that part, then you might run into some issues. When you get to ""print(""Hello Python world!"")"" and go into Tools/Build System, choose ""Python,"" DO NOT choose ""Python3."" By creating a ""Python3.sublime-build"" you are creating an extra, and unnecessary, choice under ""Build System."" Also, the program will not run if you choose ""Python3"" that you've created. So skip the part that says to create ""Python3.sublime-build."",When the author says to create a folder called ""python_work,"" you can create that folder anywhere, but you should actually create it on your Desktop because he later references it on the Desktop. Any file saved as "".py"" is similar to files saved as .docx, .xlsl, or .txt, so don't worry about messing things up or crashing your program; it's just another file. You can move that folder and file around, and it will still work, just like any other Word file.,Also, when you see "">>>"" it means that you need to run in terminal session. Go back and read page 4 or 6. Or click on the main Python 3.10 (64-bit) application, to go directly to Python terminal window.,Lastly, remember that this book was written in 2018-2019, so the author is using Python 3.7.2. We are currently on 3.10.2. Certain things may look and function a bit differently, but the program language and concept will remain the same.,print(""Good luck and happy coding!"")"
Owen C. Marshall,5.0,"Easy to Follow, Good Intro for Self Learner","May,7,,2020","With the lockdown from the global pandemic, I have been forced to work from home like many other people. Since my usual job involved supporting hardware, this meant I was going to be stuck! Fortunately, my boss said that if I could spend my time learning skills useful to the lab, I could count the hours doing that. I asked whether learning Python would count. I told him that I would try to create scripts to monitor my hardware from home. He said that was acceptable.,I have some programming experience, but it has been years since I coded, and then it was usually for relatively basic tasks in undergrad. I was looking for something that would not insult my intelligence, but that would still be interesting enough to keep me on task. So, after searching around I found this book. I saw the highly rated reviews. I skimmed the language that the author used in the sample. I read the table of contents and saw that the second part of the book consisted of creating games in order to solidify the skills learned.,Yes! This sounded perfect.,I have not been disappointed.,The book walks the reader through setting up (checking if Python is on the computer already, downloading it if necessary, using an IDE and what that is, etc). And then it moves on to the usual basic programming. The writing is clear. I had no problems with the examples and found the practice problems to be well chosen. I also liked the way that the author encouraged good practices such as documentation and testing.,I am currently in Part 2 of the book and have been working on the first project, a game called Alien Invasion which is basically a version of Space Invaders. I am definitely enjoying that. And I can see how some of the skills I learn from this could transfer over into monitoring my equipment. Reading files, taking user input, opening windows, drawing on the screen, making calculations, all of these things are necessary for the game, and for my own goals.,I personally never had any problems, but I also noticed that the author's website includes cheat sheets, solutions, and errata, not to mention the files suggested for the projects.,I am not sure if this book is for an absolute beginner. My experience is too far from that for me to be a good judge. But I can say that a person with basic programming knowledge and no prior knowledge of Python found it to be a great resource."
Michael Baudendisel,4.0,"Fantastic Resource For Beginners - Skip the Youtube Videos, Start With This","May,8,,2022","I tried learning Python using youtube videos but was unable to find a class that did a good job of explaining the basics for absolute beginners. Decided to give this book a shot and it was a night and day difference. I think those videos would be a good follow up AFTER I finish this book, but this is the perfect place to start.,Well, almost perfect. The reason I'm giving it 4 instead of five stars is that it lacks the answers to the exercises presents. During the preamble of the book, it basically says ""google the solutions."" I'm not happy with that. Answers to the exercises should be provided somewhere in the back of the book. Would be nice to confirm that I did an exercise the way the teach (author) intended. I've tried googling the answers and had a hard time finding anything definitive. If the book actually contained the answers to the exercises, then this book would be 100% perfect, but as is, it's ""almost"" perfect. If you want to learn Python, this is the book you're looking for."
Rohit kumar,5.0,Excellent,"November,15,,2022",Excellent product. No complaints. Even able to hold my Moto G Plus.
KC,4.0,Very good book but not for me,"August,12,,2022","I think this book is a decent read for those who are starting out as programmers and this is their first language. But for someone like me who has taken a few programming courses, I did not enjoy it as it is a lengthy read. I would have been fine with doing a quick online course. I think I would have preferred, ""Automate the Boring Stuff With Python,"" rather than this one."
Johnston,4.0,More Information than Expected,"April,18,,2022","First: This book has a LOT of Information. The format is broken down in a way that makes it easy as a newbie gettig into Python. It covers more things than I originally anticipated. It's one of the few books(6) I originally purchased when getting into the Python Language. It also remains my favorite in starting out. For some reason a lot of ""beginner's"" books about SQL, C++, Python Ect seem to either assume you somehow already know how to code or project the feeling your 4yrs old. This book is NOT that. It's a prefect balance imo and even though I now have moved on, I still find myself referring back to it every once in a while. Starts out with how to install, how to code, make your own game within Python more. Best book I've bought that got me into learning  hands down."
N8,5.0,Very detailed and clearly explained,"March,28,,2021","I've had some programming experience in the past.  I've written very basic Perl and Python programs in the past, and have a solid understanding of the basics, such as strings, variables, functions, statements, etc.,I got the book ""Learning Python"" and started going through it and was entirely lost; the book mostly focuses on using Python Interpreter for most of the examples, which made it confusing for me to follow along.,This book, Python Crash Course is one of the best books I've ever worked with in learning to program anything.  The author explains everything in a very detailed, yet simplistic way, and even puts numbers next to the areas he's explaining, so that the reader can understand what area of the code is being explained.,In addition, the book has numerous exercises to do at the end of each chapter that really give the reader a clear grasp of the subject matter that has been presented.  Most of the time, I tend to skip over these, because they seem so tedious and boring in other books....not so in this book.  The author tells you to go find a famous quote you like, and then use that to create an exercise where you're manipulating strings (as an example).,I'd have to say that so far, this is one of the best books I've ever worked with in regards to learning programming.  If you're new to programming, and don't know what a variable is verses a string, this is a great book to start with.  If you're like myself, and have a basic understanding of programming syntax, but have some places that are still confusing (maybe you know how to get something to work, but not know why it works for example), this is also a great book.,Best book I've read in regards to learning Python, by far."
Crafter,5.0,I consider the best book for learning Python.,"October,29,,2022",Clear explanations.  Excellent TOC and Index.  Go to more specialized books for GUI interfaces or panda.
Scott,5.0,"Excellent book, easy to understand","October,8,,2022",I used this to learn Python and I had great success. Sometimes you need to search online to expand your knowledge about a specific topic but overall a great well written book.
Julz,5.0,Great introductory programming book in python,"July,5,,2022","This is a great introductory programming book that starts with the basics and teaches about variables, lists, dictionaries, classes, and many other topics. The author explains each concept thoroughly which makes it very easy to understand. After introducing a concept, the book has exercises that test your understanding to ensure that you fully understand the content. Unlike some other books, the author provides solutions to all the exercises on his website. After teaching the basics, you work through a game, data visualization, and designing a website. In essence, this is a great and affordable book for those with little to no experience to learn how to program in python."
Some Guy,5.0,Great,"January,1,,2021","This is probably one of the best introductory programming books I've ever tried. Back when I was an undergraduate, I learned Pascal (yup, they still taught it at that point), C, and C++.  Neither the professors or the textbooks were very good at explaining...well...anything. Luckily, I was able to figure things out for myself, but it really left a sour taste in my mouth about programming (I've done scripting professionally, but it wasn't my primary role).,Fast forward to now. I have one foot in each of 2 worlds - behavioral science and IT (networking and security). Both worlds use Python. I decided to get this book and finally sit down and learn it (I was briefly introduced to Python when I was an undergraduate and asked why we didn't have a class in it, I would have preferred it). This book has very clear, concrete examples and you learn by doing. For the first half (or a little more), you'll learn the basics of what you need to navigate the language. You'll do short exercises to lock in what you learn. Later on the book, you'll actually work on larger, more involved projects and the author guides you through with excellent explanations.,Needless to say, I picked up Python faster than any language before it. I've come to really like the No Starch Press books as I find them (in general) to be well-written  and clear."
JKX,4.0,"As press company called ""no starch"", sure enough, there is not enough glue/starch serve as binder.","June,17,,2022","Just used a paper clip dumped some glue between center of the book and cover. It should fix the problem.,In terms of content, I just read a couple of pages here and there and seems to be a very decent pace for a beginner. If you already have programming background, you should blast through the book quickly. One star off due to ""no starch"" (lack of glue for the cover)."
Ryan,5.0,Thorough and easy to absorb,"August,10,,2022","For context: I'm a web developer and programmer with ~15 years of experience reading this book to get up-to-speed on Python. So my brain might be filling in some things that other people miss. However this book seems very straightforward and easy-to-read with lots of examples and written descriptions which explain what the code does and why. I'm about halfway through so far, and covering topics that I'm familiar with in other languages."
James Brumley,5.0,Looks good,"September,28,,2022",I haven't had time to sit down with this book other than a precursory glance through the chapters. Looks to be a decent reference and textbook.
pgmr,5.0,"Excellent organization, explanations, exercises","August,2,,2022","I have read about 150 pages so far and am very pleased with ""Python Crash Course"".  Organization is great in that subjects are introduced in a logical order.  Instructions are clear and explanations are concise.  The exercises are peppered throughout and allow you to practice what you've just read.  At first I thought they were too repetitive but soon realized repetition is advantageous to imprinting new procedures on my brain."
Amazon Customer,5.0,Good,"October,25,,2022",Brand new
WF,5.0,I have a whole bookshelf on Python books. Hands down the best book for beginners!,"August,20,,2020","First, I just want to say thank you for allowing multiple chapters in your free kindle preview! I get so frustrated when I go to buy a new score (music) book. Just this week I purchased a Halloween easy piano book. It only shows the cover and the index. Now one is going to steal any music if you show two or three pages of different scores. But, it lets me know if I've at the level to be able to play it. Which brings me to this book. I have many beginner Python books. I wanted to teach a friend python and couldn't really recommend a book. On Kindle, I saw this had a free preview. If it didn't I wouldn't have purchased this book. But, it had I think four free chapters. I read chapters two and three. And was hooked. Now...I am compltely paperless. I do everything by PDF. However, I'm a book person. I like having a physical book. I've tried e-books but it's just not the same. I ordered the paper book and while it was shipped I was able to keep reading thanks to the free preview.,The book is awesome. If you have NO programming background at all. This book is definitely for you. And it's written to where you can understand it with real-world examples that are relatable. I have many of the De-Mystifying books from McGraw. What some of those authors were thinking...I have no idea. The real-world example they give are not relatable to a normal human.,This book will get you quickly up-to-speed and programming in Python! It really is a crash course that people can understand!,Thanks for writing such a great book! I really enjoyed it!"
Curtis May,5.0,Great book and very intuitive.,"September,19,,2022","This book opens the door for many to learn and understand Python programing.  I am a self-taught basic, C, and a few other programming languages and now Python.  Love it."
geekandglitter,5.0,Can be used both as a reference and a teaching tool,"December,3,,2020","I am a beginner/intermediate Python programmer with many holes in my knowledge; thus I am using this book both for reference and for systematic self-teaching.,I've never seen such a thorough, comprehensive, and easy to use table of contents and index in any technical book.  This makes the book as easy to use as a reference as it is a teaching tool through building projects.,This author, who is a trained teacher, clearly has a rationale behind laying out every concept. It's no wonder it's been translated into several languages and is a best seller.,The form factor, typeface, and spacing are also carefully planned, as each page draws the eye in.,Another note of interest is that I, perhaps like many people, tend not to want to learn through building someone else's projects. I just want to learn what I need to build my own! Thus when I take online courses, I avoid those that are project based.  But a physical book can make it worthwhile to build the projects, because doing so makes it an even better reference afterward. That is, the projects become old friends rather than throw-away. I only thought of this now, looking at this book, because I am confident that if any teacher/author can make me build their project, this author can.,As programmers, we all heavily use google to find answers. I am happy to now have a physical book at my side. And just to make this book even better, it comes with lots of free meta materials which the author is actively maintaining.  This book is a find."
William Conway,4.0,Get a new IDE/compiler,"April,22,,2021","OK . . . .there are more than 4,000 reviews on this book, but I wanted to put my 2 cents in. The book is awesome and I'm only two chapters in . . .but seriously!!!!!! The Sublime Text editor the book has us downloading is weak. Now, you might have to register and pay for the service . . . .My copy said UNREGISTERED in bold letters at the top . . . .I'm not paying money for that thing and realized there are so many text editors/compilers you can get . . . I went out and used programiz.com. Now, you have to place code in your web browser. . . . and I'm not sure how objects will be affected . . . .but I was so relieved to find that all my source code worked!!!! The url is programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler . I feel great and the book is wonderful . . . .but that sublime text editor has to go . . . .I downloaded Code::Blocks for my c++ coding . . .and that thing was a beast . . .tons of information and the compiler looks solid . . . .but this sublime bull text editor is so measly . . .I have no idea how 4,000 people survived without freaking out the way I did . . . .so, if you're living in 2021 using Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes . . . .you might need a better compiler . . .I'm just saying . . . ."
John,4.0,Changing the rate,"November,4,,2019","This book does all it can to make programming formidable and boring. It's not concise. It's too wordy.,Most of it is filled with explanations and vanilla examples that just is not very enlightening.,It's first chapter ""getting started"" will make you never start.,Reading the first chapter, I decided not to read any further. Then my friend came along and did all that was intended in the chapter in less than a minute. The book spends a whole chapter on what can be done in a minute. I'm sure it meant well, but it is excessively full of explanations that are not relevant, and stuff that will just make the beginners crap.,(Do beginners really have to know anything about Python 2? Or the difference between Python 2 and 3? Seriously? If not, why did you put it on the very first chapter?),It just doesn't get any better in the later chapters.,This is a passage from Chapter 2:,""When an error occurs in your program, the Python interpreter does its,best to help you figure out where the problem is. The interpreter provides,a traceback when a program cannot run successfully. A traceback is a record,of where the interpreter ran into trouble when trying to execute your code.,Here’s an example of the traceback that Python provides after you’ve accidentally,misspelled a variable’s name ... "",WTF.,If the book was intended for beginners - can't understand. If the book was intended for developers familiar with other languages - too verbose.,----------------------------------------------------------------------,<updated later>,Actually, now that I'm beyond the very very early phase, this book is pretty fun to read. And quite helpful.,I've been going back and forth between three introductory books, but this is the one that I actually find most enjoyable and helpful.,Sorry about the earlier comment, but I think few points are still valid."
Marvin,5.0,Very good intro to python!,"September,3,,2022","The programming concepts are very clear. Which are illustrated with good examples.,Also, the projects are very useful and practical. A good starting point for any programmer.,I use this book to teacher intro computer science."
Dan,4.0,Great inner content! Not that great outer quality. Still worth it!,"July,5,,2019","Have had this for one day and the cover is already coming off. Nothing a little glue won’t fix, and that’s the downside of paperbacks that you have to put weight on to keep closed, in my opinion.,BUT the inner content is well worth it. I’ve been wanting to learn programming for years but have often gone away discouraged because the tutorials and teachers randomly start throwing complicated problems at you out of nowhere.,Not so with this book. It eases you into each topic, breaks it down very clearly, and has exercises throughout that you can follow along with. Make sure you follow along! There are specific exercises throughout, but I highly recommend typing out the example code and playing around with it/experimenting on your own as well. Then by the time you get to the exercises you’ll have a good idea about how to approach it.,STICK WITH IT! I decided I wanted to learn to program 10 years ago! I would start for a week and then quit when it got too complicated and felt overwhelming. Then I’d come back to it a few years later, and same thing. Then it hit me one day, “If I had pushed through the first time and been patient, I’d have 10 years of experience as a programmer right now. Do I want to look back in another 10 years and feel that way again? Or do I want to push through this time so in 10 years I’ll actually have the experience under my belt!?”,Easy answer!,Stick with it. Be patient with yourself if things get too complicated or you “feel too dumb” to get it. If you hit a block, go back a few pages and go through it again. Everyone is selling “learn ____ quick!” books these days. It’s a good way to get random chunks of knowledge but a terrible way to master it. So be patient!,And get this book. :). It makes things very simple to understand and really holds your hand through everything."
idontwanttomakeone,4.0,"Binding does pop off. Definitely for people with zero code experience, but still a great reference.","May,13,,2020","My background is in JS, so I was looking for something that would both help me navigate installing Python3, learning the language syntax and differences in rules, and delve a little deeper in classes & objects.,So far, it's clear that this is set up for absolute beginners, and I wouldn't call it a ""crash"" course. It's extremely thorough about walking you through common syntax errors you'll probably make on your own. I do like that it encourages you to play with breaking the code, which is absolutely necessary for learning how to code, but it's a little hand-holdy. I was expecting the guidance to loosen up as you went on, but as of chapter 6 out of the 11 chapters that introduce the topics, it's still very sheltered.,I'd suggest people wanting a little more challenge/for things to stick a little longer read the first ""A Simple ___"" section whenever a topic is introduced, then jump to the exercises. See what you can accomplish there just from seeing the example code, and if you run into trouble, then go back through all of the ""how to do this exact thing"" stuff.,Using the book this way, it's been a great reference book, and a quick read. I wish more complex ideas were introduced earlier, like conditionals/loops, so that the exercises could introduce more problem-solving than you can get with just print earlier, but I'm looking forward to the projects section.,Oh, and yeah the binding did pop off on day 1. But it was super clean, so I just dabbed some rubber cement on the spine. It's not a big deal."
JohnP,5.0,Great resource,"July,31,,2022","Layout is great and I really liked the online helps .,I would like to see the book supplemented with a searchable digital copy also.,Maybe it has one and I just missed it in the resource page .,Author has a great view of the world and how to use Python !!!!"
Bill,5.0,Great book,"April,3,,2022","This book is great! It immediately has you working in Python and each exercise builds from the last one. This book is so far has easily taught basic concepts of coding in general. The only thing I would suggest is to introduce commenting right after the Hello World exercise, I was already familiar with commenting so I added them as I did the exercises. So that's really my only bit it criticism so far with this book.,I'm only on chapter 4 but so far I love this book. I use this book with PyCharm and have a much better understanding of code now more than ever. Each chapter has interactive lessons and exercises to do based on those lessons through the chapter. Excellent book."
Jenna,5.0,Learning the Basics Quickly,"April,7,,2022","Everything was well thought out and explained.,Gave me a great refresh and a great foundation for Python.,I should mention that I plan to go bank into the workforce after 9+ years. I have prior coding in my background and lots of SQL & stored procedures (Teradata) in my background.,My only complaint is the same as many reviewers said about the binding. Couldn't hold it open to get the exercises at the end of the chapters done. Decided to spend the $8 and get it spiral-bound at Staples. Well worth it!,I wonder if the author and publisher could consider selling it this way (as an option) since most of his customers are serious about learning!,Thanks Again!"
Noah Benedict,5.0,An Excellent Introduction,"November,19,,2020","i have a very hard time with reading and comprehension. most text books or educational materials are super hard for me to read due to various disabilities. i have wanted to learn how to program for a very long time, but i was intimidated by most texts and felt discouraged that someone with these issues could never learn to program,but this book is amazing. its formatted well to be informative but accessible, it explains things well and the project-based learning is awesome. ive only spent a few days reading it but ive already learned so much, when it usually takes me weeks to get where i am with only half as much comprehension. you can tell the author knows how intimidating it looks to a lot of people who dont know the first thing about coding languages, because they have explained it in a way that i could grasp immediately.,if youre looking to learn Python, i would recommend this book 100000%. i hope this author has other books on different programming languages, because if this is how they wrote Python, ill definitely read the others.,10/10, amazing, im enjoying learning through this method so much. its not easy learning a language for the first time- but this books helps you work through the difficulties through small projects and encouraging readers to make errors to see what errors look like, and what fixes them"
D. Smith,4.0,Kindle Version Code Examples Issues,"April,2,,2022","I have the kindle version and I do like the content.  One complaint I have is with the code examples...the pictures I have included are from chapter 7.  A snippet of the book and a screen shot of my computer... The example code can be convoluted at times (tabs and spacing) and  if not done correctly the program won't work as expected.,Other than that I'm finding it useful to learn Python3."
Amazon Customer,5.0,this book!,"August,19,,2022",all you need is this book and a computer and you will be on your way to learning Python code. it’s up to date AND totally worth the investment considering what Python code can earn you.
Patrick Hoang,4.0,Great start for Beginners in Programming and Python! But Needs Better Practice Problems.,"October,17,,2020","It took me some time to get around to learn Python scripting, but so far it is simple and straight forward in how to program in Python.  If you want to get in further depth, it would definitely be good to check out O'Reillys books for Python as they are more in depth technically(have not used it, but my coworker has told me so).,Reason why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5, is due to the simplicity of the practice problems and wording.  I wish it was more challenging and utilizes the previous chapters we learned and continues to implement it in the current chapters, as an ongoing and repetitive learning.  If the author followed the practice problems ""C Programming Language"" by Dennis M. Ritchie and Brian W. Kernighan(very good C programming book by the way), then it would definitely be more challenging and allow the person to think and be more creative.  The problems the author gives are okay, but I used them to think of more creative things.,Definite good investment in having a physical copy, reading it and going through the book and examples.  But please do your best to also make problems that you wish to solve and implement from what you learned through this book."
Amazon Customer,5.0,Excellent Introductory Book,"June,9,,2020","This book is excellent for anyone who wants to learn a computer language from the ground up.  It walks you through the free software to install (how to install it and trouble shoot any issues you may have), gives plenty of examples and discusses common errors, and has made learning Python easy and fun.,My background is NOT in computer science, but in mathematics.  I have very little experience programming.  I purchased this book because my 10 year old was interested in learning to program and I wanted to be able to help him get started.  I'm not sure if he would have the patience to read the book on his own, but any adult or kid over the age of 13 should be good to go.,The quality of construction of the book cover is ""meh"".  It came undone after a few days of use, but the binding is good (nothing a little glue in the spine wont fix).  The paper and printing are of good quality.  I wouldn't let this minor issue deter me from recommending this book to others.,The software for python doesn't need much to run.  In fact, there are apps out there for running it on phones or tablets.  You don't need a full fledged PC to use this software (and again it is free).,Best of luck programming.  It is fun!"
Marcos,5.0,Exactly what I was looking for! [UPDATED],"October,29,,2020","I am 8 chapters in and so far all my expectations have been exceeded. The book is very well organized and assumes the reader is starting from virtually zero programming experience. If you've got an analytical mind and love solving problems, you'll be okay. I have a lot of experience in Excel where some of the longer formulas indeed feel like mini-programs, so certain things in coding like variables, Boolean expressions (True/False) were already familiar.,I would strongly recommend trying to work through the exercises on your own before peeking at the solutions on the website. I know it's tempting, and it may take 30, 45 minutes or more to figure it out, but when you do it's a marvelous feeling!,I've read comments that the book is poor quality and comes apart at the spine, but so far that has not been my experience. Possibly it happens down the road but right now, after 3+ days with it opened on my desk, it's holding up fine.,Big recommend!!,UPDATE: Unsurprisingly, given how many others had the same problem, the spine of my book came apart this morning. It's an easy fix w/ some glue, but it's disappointing that the physical quality is this poor. No Starch needs to do better."
M.M,5.0,Python is easy to learn with this book,"May,18,,2021","I purchased this book and quickly dived into it.  I am on halfway into chapter 5 and am surprised at how fun it is to learn Python.  The explanation to code and how it works is easy to understand.  I like the mini Try It Yourself within the chapter or towards the end, where you get to try out what you learned.  If you get stuck, a simple Google search will help you further expand your knowledge.  I am enjoying learning Python at my own pace.  I needed it this for work and it is helping tons!  If you are looking for a new program to learn or just want to advance your knowledge, pick up this book.  I am also teaching my 10-year old daughter how to program in Python.  She understood the concepts and explanations well enough to do what the book says on her own.  This book is not hard.  Dedicate 1 hour a day and YouTube or Google some issues if you get stuck."
Giordano Bruno,5.0,Good introduction to Python,"June,18,,2022","Well explained Python basics. I am half through the book and loving it. I hated Python before this book arrived to my book shelf, so I changed my mind on it and started over. I have some previous Java experience, can guarantee you that Python is much easier."
Ray Elkins,5.0,Everything I was Looking For,"September,16,,2021","I’ve tried to learn Python off and on for the last 4 years. Each time I was discouraged by the content I was using to learn. Everyone seems to want to teach Python like it’s Algebra. I hated Algebra and never got higher than a ‘C’ in it. Because my new role can really make use of learning a programming language, I thought what the hell. I bought this book expecting it to be collecting dust by chapter 2. I was wrong. I have covered 1.5 chapters each week for the last 7 weeks. It is quite evident that the author is a teacher because he understands that well thought out examples make a difference. No Algebraic expressions here…just really fun, real world examples to work on. I have confidently went from zero to hero. This book, if used appropriately, can take you to a comfortable intermediate level (250-300 level). I’m now teaching fundamentals to new learners."
Felipe Marin,5.0,Good for begginers!,"September,1,,2022",Easy to understand and it has great projects!
Carlos Hernandez,5.0,Can’t wait to start learning Python,"August,8,,2022","Heard a lot of good things about this book, finally decided to buy it! Came fast and I’m great condition."
michael bouley,3.0,i got them,"October,25,,2022",works good
DJ,4.0,"Not very detail oriented, but enough to get someone started with Python","March,4,,2022","I was disappointed in that it didn't have a lot of details.  It certainly is not a reference guide or detailed - how-to book, but enough to get someone started with Python.  After using the book one can just google more about the language to learn more."
Tim O,5.0,Great resource to start Python,"May,2,,2022","I love this book. My fourth No Starch Press book and like the others, clear, concise, engaging and informative.  Author Eric Matthes does a fine job of gently but effectively leading a newbie into the world of programming.  I must also confess to loving the artwork and book design that marks a No Starch Press book.  Thank You."
Voyager,5.0,Great way to start learning Python.,"April,9,,2022","I’m new at this - never studied computer science, never programmed anything in my life. This book is set up for the true beginner like me. I’m halfway through it and have been able to understand all the concepts so far, and I’m able to make basic programs. Python seems to be a popular programming language globally, so I’m glad to be able to start learning it on my own. Very pleased so far."
Ian Knott,5.0,Get it!,"May,11,,2021","It will guide you well, and you will learn. I am almost done with the book, and it has exceeded my expectations. If you are a person who learns better with a physical object, I would recommend buying books for your learning process. I have been doing Codecademy pro, udemy, and many other online tools, but this one is it I can now write my own code without using the internet to figure it out. It isn't just a guide on how to build something (though it does have that) it teaches you the syntax and proper format. Make sure you do every programming example and read through each of them to better understand. Also, try all the project ideas they have inside. If this book doesn't work for you attend a community college course on intro to programming or something. But I am sure you will get it once you read this book!"
Leeber Cohen,5.0,"Wonderful tool. Not enough math and physics,","November,11,,2020","There are numerous positive reviews of this text as a excellent learning tool for Python. The code for the longer excercises can all be downloaded from the  publisher's website. This is particularly wonderful for the long projects particularly the Space Alien Game. If you are interested in math and statistics you will need to supplement this text with other publications. Math Adventures with Python and Doing Math with Python  from the same publisher were fun. However, the math is at pretty at high school level.  The Math Adventures with Python uses Processing graphics software which  several reviewers were not happy with. I hope to explore other publications and review them as I go. I would mention that I a am using Anaconda with Python 3.8 for the crash course. Matplotlib and several over libraries  are easily called without any  Path issues. Python Crash Course is a wonderful text and the author strongly deserves our thanks for the dedication and preparation involved."
Dilipkumar Nair,5.0,Very good book.,"August,15,,2022",This is a really very good book.
Amazon Customer,4.0,"Written with the best of intentions, but falls a bit short","September,16,,2019","For a start, the cover falls off. That seems to have happened to other readers.  At least it makes it easier to keep the book open at the page you are reading while using your other two hands on the computer keyboard. The instructions on how to complete the installation of Python and Sublime Text so they would work together was not clear enough for me – I had to get help before I could make anything work. But then, progress through the chapters seems slow, especially if you are going to do all the exercises: The explanations are clear enough but I kept on wanting to look ahead to find out how to do something the book hadn't got to yet, and this is where I found the most frustrating inadequacy: the index is not helpful enough. If you want to find out how to copy a list to a file, for example, you won't find  any reference to that in the index.  Searching the internet is much more productive. Perhaps I was looking for a reference book rather than  ""crash course"". I needed the book but it didn't work as a crash course for me. It might for somebody with more patience."
Louis Tyson,5.0,One of the Best DIY Software Development Books I've Encountered so far!!,"February,17,,2021","I like the way Eric laid out his material and examples in such a way that each one formed a chain of the whole. Moreover, he not gave great examples, he took the time to give more of the like along with a detailed explanation of that example.  Again, each example flowed smoothly into the next as well as into the next subject and chapter.,Honestly, have spent thousands of dollars in books and classes related to computer science, and this book and the Head First books are all money well spent!  This course actually formed together many of the concepts which I spent years learning in classrooms with a far greater understanding. Also prayer helps as well.,Although, I must say in my opinion the Head First guides are great but the authors of these Python books tend get to the point a bit faster and smoother than them."
Alex D.,5.0,Learned a lot very quickly,"April,8,,2022",This book has made it easy for me to get a basic understanding of Python coding in such a short time. The explanations of how and why certain codes are doing what they do are very easy to understand. I ordered a second book from them and can't wait to crack into it and have already added more books from them to my cart.
Ivan Figueroa,3.0,Disappointed,"July,3,,2022","The book was perfect up until where you start making your own projects. I had been following along perfectly and learning a lot, and that made me very excited, however I am currently in the middle of the Alien invasion project and it's horrible. The author uses Pygame but does not explain any of the mechanisms of behind it at all and it sucks when you're copying code from a book that would not be able to replicate by yourself."
Mike Trumpfheller,4.0,Cover and content,"September,15,,2020","Cover:,I have this book now 2 weeks and today I discovered that the cover was detached.,Probably a cheap clue was used. $40 for a book where the cover falls off, ..,The Paper and the print is decent.,The Index is a bit thin.,Content:,You can find the code explained in the book on git, for download.,../ehmatthes/pcc_2e/,One of the best readable books for Python I read so far.,List of books I read at least the half of,* The Quick Python book (Naomi Ceder)),* Automate the boring stuff with Python,* Starting out with Python 2nd Ed_Gaddis,*Think Python, Downey, O'Reilly,Downer:,Since Py3 there have been changes in the env var which majorleague suck.,Homebrew recommends to delete some libraries from python2 but you need to,be careful: keep python2 installed on your Mac or apps won't function and you have to reinstall,the entire OS."
A. Viz,5.0,Great for beginners!,"December,31,,2021","I've tried many different methods to learn Python, but nothing really stuck. I took a course in grad school specific to ArcGIS, but wanted to get a basic understanding before trying to apply to ArcPy once again.,I think because the author is a high school teacher, he really breaks down why code is written in a certain way. I'm about 1/3 way through now and hope the projects section is just as good as the beginning of the book. I'll definitely look for the next Python book from this author."
Cici,5.0,Great book for beginners,"April,15,,2022","After buying several python book and taking several online tutorials that didn't work for me, I found this book. This book goes step by step into python concepts with examples and exercises. The answers are available online in case you need it.,I really recommend this book."
Kay,5.0,Learning a lot with this book!!! (beginner),"February,23,,2021","I love this book. I am a beginner, and I have been trying to study and finding ways to keep all the,info in my head, but I always get overwhelmed. In most of the videos and courses I have taken the people teaching,it don't make it clear or not even their fault but they teach it in a way that only programmers will know not the complete beginner(even though most say its for beginners). Anyone out there looking to really learn and practice what they learned, this book is for you trust me.  The author Eric Matthes explains it with good details and doesn't make you feel like you are just putting info in your head that you can't use, it's the total opposite. you keep what you learn and know exactly what everything is actually used for."
JJH Colorado,5.0,Best software language tutorial I've used in decades,"May,20,,2021","I don't write a lot of five star reviews, but now that I'm half way though this book it's time to give this one a top rating.  A developer by trade, I'm coming out of retirement and learning python.  This book is like a good college text book.  Written so that someone with little programming knowledge can learn the language and learn it well, it's also good for development veterans who want a solid foundation with python.  If you approach this like a tutorial and you read through it and do the examples (and add in your own), you'll have a pretty good grasp on the language.  Of course there's room for advanced topics when you are done.  A five star review from me for this book."
Samson,3.0,Overall Pleased,"December,7,,2020","The first 8 chapters are presented at a good pace with lots of exercises.  (Work the exercises).  Exercises are challenging the first time you see them.  Ch 9 (Classes) didn't stick the first time through, but maybe it's the material ??  I expect to have to repeat it several times.,There is a BIG step up into chapter 12 -- the first large project -- Alien Invasion.  Found myself in a position of typing in the code, and understanding the code, but knowing I could not write the code.  What makes it especially difficult was -- to save space -- the author plugged snippets of code into partial program listings while telling you in the text to delete sections of code.  I would suggest that's a very poor way of changing the code as it's extremely easy for the user to mess up.  I got frustrated to the point of just quitting several times working through this portion of the book.  This cost it a star.,Also, the code ran extremely slow -- taking half an hour to load.  Not sure what that's about.  Looked online but couldn't find anybody with a similar problem.  Like everybody else said -- the binding is awful -- but the content is really good.  Especially true of the first 8 chapters.  This would be a 4 star review were it not for the binding."
Amazon Customer,5.0,This is a GREAT book!,"June,9,,2020","I read this book after taking an introductory online course. The online course did a great job of helping me understand the core concepts of Python, but left out a lot of the conventions (such as formatting). This is where the book REALLY comes in handy. The author puts an emphasis on common formatting used within the industry.,The examples and the exercises are extremely well thought out and really helped me understand the code. The examples are usually something you'd encounter in real-life and when the author expands the code for those examples its done so bit by bit so you get a full understanding of what is actually going on.,First half of the book is all about learning python. The second half walks you through big projects, such as a video game, web page, or web application. I've done all the exercises and am currently working on the video game project.,HIGHLY recommended for anyone trying to pick up Python."
Brian Gorman,5.0,THE BEST book for learning Python,"March,12,,2020","I am a total beginner to programming. In my quest to learn Python, I tried parts of some video courses, and even the Head First Python book. They were all good, HFP being the best of the group. But this book, in my opinion, is perfect. This is a lifelong programmer taking you through a perfectly logical learning course, laying a foundation from which to build upon. Just go through it slowly and methodically, type everything in the book along the way and ponder it, and I have no doubt you will learn this language and use it capably.,The other thing I love is that he never goes more than a few pages without pausing for exercises, and the exercises are never too difficult. It's exactly what was just discussed, and the solutions are on his website if you need them (I rarely did bc of how well the material was presented).,I emphatically recommend this. For me, it's the beginner's master text and I'm so glad I found this author."
Eric Wood,4.0,Python Step by Step,"September,27,,2021",Other reviews that suggest this book moves too slowly and is repetitive are essentially correct. But I am not saying that is a negative...this is a great book to cement the fundamentals.  Calling this a crash course is a bit of a misnomer...you will not feel as if you are being thrown into the deep end. This takes a measured and gradual series of steps  using reinforcement exercises along the way to get you comfortable with Python.
Jean Pargetter,3.0,Dull Graphics,"July,16,,2022","This book is very clearly written and the exercises simple to follow and advance with. As other reviews have stated, instructions are written comprehensively so that Python skills can be learned without many stumbles.,But alas, the format is really dull. Surely, surely in this day and age, books of this kind can be written with appealing layouts and designs."
arcccc,5.0,Pleased,"June,29,,2021","I tried the video tutorials, the Udemy courses, skillshare, youtube bingefest-- nothing stuck. Since I did not have a background in programming, I found myself asking questions like ""okay why did you choose that name for a variable and not this? Why are you changing the variable name now? Is there a specific way for doing this and that? Why are we doing this? Can it be done another way?"" and the lecturer went on without explaining themselves. With this book, the author did just that in a very detailed and concise manner. Everything is broken down like he anticipated the exact questions I had. He is good at teaching. I am glad I found this resource. He should write more books on Python."
Nestor,5.0,"I learnt so much,","July,16,,2022","Good book, I’m new, good projects"
Jonathan,5.0,Best 10/10,"May,13,,2022",I'm not much of a reader but I think this is the only book that I've completely finished. I recommend it to everyone who wants to start in the world of programming
Ortega52,3.0,Too early for a 5 Star,"May,29,,2022","I decided to buy the second edition of this book cause my son suddenly wanted to learn Python.  He asked me if I could recommend a book, so I suggested Python Crash Course.  We are on chapter 2, and noticed that the section on Combining Strings has been omitted on his second edition.  It is not a deal breaker, but I wonder what else has changed/omitted from his Second edition.  Perhaps, he mentions it down the road."
satish,5.0,Best book.,"July,6,,2022",Best book to start learning python coding .
Mr magic,3.0,Good for programming fundamentals!,"October,3,,2021","I like how the first part of the books explains the fundamentals of programming in python and that you can apply these fundamentals in other languages. My issue with learning part 1 of the book is that I had to keep looking up other explanations on google for methods and some of the concepts. He did not really help the reader understand python syntax. So better explanation in part 1.,I just started part 2, I’m making the alien invasion game and he is not explaining it very well. im having a hard time understanding some of pygames methods and function, the author is not explaining them very efficient . So I’m going to have to read the pygame documentation to get a better understanding! i feel like the author did put much effort into the last part of the book. so im going to move on to another book to practice python!,Overall ig it’s pretty good he definitely needs some improvement. Part one is what I really like ! Idk about part 2 becuase he is not explaining the code very well."
J. Hersh,4.0,Great book for learning python! Very informative and fun to follow. Easy read!,"August,18,,2020","I enjoyed this book immensely as someone who has tried to get into python multiple times over the past few years and got bored halfway through. I actually found myself enjoying the content of this book so much that I would continually go back into it each day to learn more and practice. After 7+ years I may finally be able to learn Python in its entirety! The projects are also interesting to follow and help wrack your brain around the processes behind the code.,The only complaint I have about this book is that the cover separated from the binding due to shoddy glue work. I  treat my books with respect and it still somehow popped off. Not a huge deal as the front cover is connected with glue but definitely a bit disappointing.,Hard recommend for beginners."
James PJ,5.0,Brilliant Writing,"June,8,,2020","First off, I want to enter a quote from page 173: ""This brings you to an interesting point in your growth as a programmer.  When you wrestle with questions like these, you're thinking at a higher logical level rather than a syntax-focused level.  Your're thinking not about Python, but about how to represent the real world in code.""  This quote reminds me of another: ""the best programming is done by programmers immersed in the environment they are writing for.  I was lucky to be immersed and programming in a clinical environment.  I've been out of that (programming) environment for about eight years and grabbed this book because I'd been missing this kind of thinking.  Matthes is great at teaching syntax and great at getting you thinking about program modeling in the real world.  Great book, but you might need a wee bit of glue to keep the cover on."
RiskyOne,5.0,Excellent resource for beginners.,"October,2,,2020","Over the past 3 years I have worked with one object  oriented programming language, VBA. Basically, I've taught myself by watching countless video, visiting numerous websites, purchasing lessons and books and hours of trial in error. When I decided to take on Python, I wanted to approach it differently and get a good understanding, so I decided to purchase a highly rated beginner's book. Python Crash Course was recommended on a programming website. I decided to purchase it and give it a go. The author of Python Crash Course, Eric Matthes, does a phenomenal job explaining the language and providing simplified examples. What I have found most beneficial is the break down and explanation of each step he provides after almost every example. Giving you the ""why's"" behind the process. I highly recommend this publication to any beginner who wants solid understanding of Python."
B Sherwood,5.0,What a Great place to Start,"September,26,,2019","I am not brand new to programming entirely, but my experience with programming was in C++ over a decade ago.  I have always had a desire to learn to program because why not learn to speak another language that is so useful.  Well this book even though I have only had it for a few days now is amazing.  I have tried learning with the immense amount of YouTube videos out there and have quickly been side tracked.  I like this book because it provides structure to my learning.  I am able to have a ""lesson plan"".  I guess it is kind of old school of me to want a textbook to learn from, but what can I say if it works, it works.  This book is well laid out and easy to understand.  I like that it has been recently updated, which is helpful to be on the same update of python as the book. All together very pleased so far and will continue to use more books by this publisher."
Jodi,5.0,Excellent step by step with online support/resources,"May,17,,2021","I purchased this book for a college class.  Since the class was delivered online, much of my learning was on my own.  This book is an excellent step by step guide from start to finish with easy to comprehend text, as well as examples of code.  It also has three projects to do, a video game (Alien Invasion), a data visualization project, and a web applications project.  I have no coding/programming experience at all and at the end of 8 weeks, I created a pretty awesome video game!  I plan on doing the data visualization project next!  The text is very well written and has online supplements and resources in case you get stuck."
Chen Junzhou,5.0,THE BOOK for Beginners!,"May,2,,2021","After finishing another beginner's book and feeling confused and lost, I am so glad I bought this book. And this is THE book!!! Very clearly organized and thoroughly explained. After introduction of each concept, the author always demonstrates  how to apply it to in your coding, the thought process, and the purpose of each line of codes.  For the practical project, the author shows how to start a project from scratch, and the step by step thinking, coding, refactoring, revising, so detailed that I feel like the author is right next to me guiding me through it. I dont know how anyone else could do a better job! So much better than the other book...  I love it."
Amazon Customer,5.0,Great book for a beginner,"April,15,,2022",Book's material is very easy to digest compared to other programming books. The way the author writes out the concepts are very relatable and the vocabulary used isn't trying to sound technical when not necessary. A+ in my book.
Amazon NV customer,5.0,Excellent book,"November,2,,2021","Excellent introduction to Python.  Well organized and very well written.  I didn't go through the latter part on a game example, but got what I needed from the main body of the book.  Thorough description of lists and dictionaries and how to use them.  I've been writing Fortran programs since 1976 and am fluent in C++ and VB.Net, and found this book an excellent resource for learning Python's specifics which are very different from what I'm used to."
Jimmy R. Russell,5.0,Great book. Helped a ton!,"October,8,,2020","This book didn't feel like a crash course but didn't feel like a textbook either. The author briskly reviewed some key basic concepts and gave the odd pointer here or there, and the book promptly moved on to some real-world examples. The author also gives you an overview of what is out there in the Python ecosystem, which is helpful because there is a lot out there. It is not like Java where everything you need is in the API. If you're like me and you had a background in programming already, that's exactly what you were looking for. If you are completely new to programming and you've decided to learn in Python, this would still be a good book to buy but you may want to buy another book to complement it."
Tony,4.0,Worth the purchase!!,"May,30,,2020","I am an IT student with no prior knowledge of coding and just finished my first class. It was a struggle and I decided to spend the summer getting better before the next coding course start in the fall. The book covers a great deal but if you are a beginner the author does a great job of not just teaching how to code but also explains what is going on behind the scenes.,The first half of the book covers basic topics and the second half consists of three projects that delve deeper into the world of python.,I burned through this book in less than a week and plan on checking out as much as I can (Automate the boring stuff is next on my list) by this author over the summer."
Rolands,5.0,Amazing book!,"November,26,,2021","What I liked the most is the author is using very simple language and examples to explain concepts. Thanks to this book I realized that programming isn't so difficult as it initialy seems. Many other tutors fail to do that, they are giving very superficial theory and very hard tasks out from nowhere without explanation but not in this book! I strongly recommend the book to everyone who want to learn programming."
Christopher Hatton,5.0,Perfect for beginners!!,"May,11,,2022",This book is perfect for beginners. Easy to understand text and examples. Great resource with great resources for the reader.
Jack,4.0,An interesting book,"February,8,,2022",I am just beginning the book.  It does seem promising.
Vaddi,5.0,A wonderful resource for Python Beginners! Weak binding though.,"October,7,,2020","First things first, I'm completely new to programming. I have a fair understanding of propositional logic, and that's it.,Con:,One gripe I have is that the binding immediately came out after using it for 2 weeks. It's pretty unfortunate, but I won't hesitate to rate this book for 5 stars on the content alone. If ever a third edition is made, I strongly recommend have better bindings to the publisher.,Pros:,With that out of the way, I love this book. It has a thorough ""read-example-here"" approach and then relevant exercises you should do afterward. This is a great book to start learning Python as long as you're motivated to read! Don't sleep on this book if you ever ideated wanting to learn how to program."
Chase,5.0,Good book,"June,20,,2022",Good for beginners
B,5.0,The best Python course I’ve found yet.,"March,15,,2021","I’ve tried a lot of the free tutorials online: classes, pdf, etc. and nothing compares to this physical book. It starts off like most tutorials with the user creating the “hello world” program, but then uses each chapter to introduce a new topic while still using the topics previously learned. If I forget something I can easily flip back and refresh my memory. The chapters are short and concise, the appendices are helpful, and the book is easy to follow. I’ve given up many times when trying to use online guides and tutorials, but I find myself wanting to spend my free time working through this book and thoroughly enjoy it."
W. K. Holton,5.0,From your first exception errror to your first Hello World.,"March,3,,2020","3 years ago I read this book without knowing much about programming at all.,I am now very familiar with python and this book is the reason why. It kept me motivated and not discouraged. Other books for beginners I read just killed the fun, but this book statys easy to read, simple to follow and does not have a bunch computer science jumble that makes it hard to learn new things.,In my experience if you want to learn a language you need to dive in. This book dives in with small, simpme chunks that you can see output right away. The code is simple to read and doesn't complicate things with to many methods and calls.,You will need to know some basic computer skills like installing a editor, and how to use a keyboard,  but other than that it's a amazing beginner book!"
Jason Guaschino,5.0,10/10 recommend,"March,4,,2022","Can’t recommend this book enough! In my opinion this is better then a college class, better then w3 schools, and better then codecademy! I feel like I’m learning and advancing so quickly with this book!"
L B.,5.0,Buy this book,"October,11,,2020","Seriously, buy this book.  My programming experience prior was limited to a single semester class where all I learned was basic concepts without any actual language skills, and that was over a decade ago.  Less than halfway through this excellent text, and I was already starting the command line game project I had in mind.  Honestly, I was skeptical before and probably wouldn't have bought the book if it had not been discounted, but having seen how quickly I was grasping the concepts, I can wholeheartedly recommend this book at any price point.  There is a reason so many sources suggest this as a wonderful entry point to Python.,tl:dr - Want to learn Python, Buy this book."
Justin,5.0,Its exactly as it says a project based learning system,"March,14,,2022",Its good to for what it says. When you are doing your own projects there are resources online and on youtube to help you solve troubleshooting problems when on your own.
T,5.0,This book made coding more understandable than any of the online resources I was using,"August,4,,2021",I bought this book after struggling on Codecademy. It's very well written and easy to understand. The way Eric has written this book is exactly how I take notes. It just clicks! Even the harder concepts just need some time and rereading but I was able to follow along with every single exercise. I 100% recommend it for someone who has never coded a single line of Python in their lives. (Btw I recommend Visual Studio Code for your text editor instead of Sublime like the book suggests).
Wesley S. Thomas,5.0,This book has exceeded the expectation of my son.,"October,15,,2020","This review was written by my Son Joshua J. Thomas, who I purchased the book for. He's currently a student studying Cyber Security.,I'm super excited to have a book on python finally. I've heard the hype for this language throughout the web and educational circle for a while now, and now I finally learn it myself.,When I got the book, I thought it would be a flimsy 200 or so page read. Not this. Boasting 507 pages, I know when I'm done, I'll have something to show for. Since this is a project-based book, I'll have a body of work to use as a testament to my new found skills. I'm ready to work."""
adam majewski,5.0,Great read,"April,30,,2022",Absolutely getting bang for your buck here great read with a bunch of information.
satisfied customer,5.0,Excellent Book!,"September,4,,2020","I love this book! I am learning so much! The chapters aren't too long. The hands-on exercises are excellent. The book wanted its readers to install Sublime Text for Python; however, I couldn't program Sublime Text to work. No worries! I used Visual Studio Code to execute Python commands and it worked just fine! All the material in this book is well-written and easy to understand. I am really getting this and it feels great to master yet another programming language.  This is by far the best programming book that I have ever read and purchased. I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn Python. It is no wonder why this book is rated number one! Great buy!"
Collected,5.0,Good introduction for someone who knows nothing about Python,"August,27,,2021","I bought this book because I wanted to help out with a project that involved Python -- I didn't even understand what was required of me. I'm about halfway through, and am already feeling a lot more comfortable about the project. The book lays things out in a very systematic way, with exercise that help you figure out exactly what's going on (and makes lots of mistakes along the way, which is always valuable though annoying at the time) . . ."
RigelulZ,3.0,Great Book if You Are Brand New,"November,24,,2021","Great quality book if you're brand new to programming concepts and languages in general. Having some basic previous programming experience and having read things like ""Eloquent JavaScript"", I found most of the examples to be way too basic. I still found the content the author included and his explanations to be worthwhile reading even for those that are past the very beginner stages of programming. Python is a must have skill in today's technical job market, it is an elegant and effective scripting language with a growing future. I definitely recommend this book as a quick primer or a way to brush up on syntax and learning ""Pythonic"" ways of crafting your code."
Taylor,5.0,Great introductory,"July,31,,2020","my only complaint is, since this is an introductory book, it should give resources or cover common install issues such as placing things in the path. this is needed at the beginning of the book, and without prior programming/systems experience, this could be a huge complication.  being in path may or may not be the default, depending on your system and download specifications. however this book still deserves a five star rating because it is very straight forward, building skills and competency from the ground up.  i also really liked that there was a git and github section included because version control platforms can be confusing at first, but with a straight forward explanation, not hard to get used to."
Chris,5.0,Common sense python!,"May,7,,2021",I don't normally do reviews but I felt this book warrants one. Just like anything you buy from anywhere this book might not be for everyone.  Kindly research it before you buy it but I loved it! It helped me grasps the concept of python programming. It really helped me walk through the problems and learn the solutions. The book doesn't feel cheaply made. The paper isn't that bad quality flimsy super thin paper that some books have. I recommend this book to those who want to learn python.
Seth Ward,5.0,Easy to get started with Python,"May,5,,2020","I needed to learn basic Python for a specific project I had in mind. My previous ""code"" experience includes HTML/CSS and enough Javascript to dress up websites and make basic widgets to use at work. My hope with this book was to learn enough to get a barebones version of the project running then hand it off to a real programmer. I finished the first half of the book, which is the basics, and decided to try out a couple ideas before moving on to the ""example projects"" part of the book. The examples are great but some were honestly overkill for what I needed. To my surprise I had a working program in a few days. I recommend this book for anyone starting out with Python."
Mohamed Abd Al Aziz,4.0,tracking no,"December,22,,2021",Please learn me the tracking No.
Brian D Bozzuto,5.0,Really outstanding book!,"July,21,,2021",I was trying to come up with pandemic activities and started coding python with my 12 year old son and some of his friends. After a couple weeks I turned to this book and it worked out really great. The examples were thorough and well explained. While they lost interest after some of the games I kept going and must say the contents really give a good introduction to python and some important development concepts
David Derocher,5.0,Really good book but bad build quality,"June,8,,2021","I’m only about 60 pages in but this book has taught me more in those 60 pages than I learned as a freshman in college. It does a great job explaining how things work. My only complaint is the quality of the book itself is very poor. The paper separated from the spine almost instantly. I’m sure you could superglue it or something, it’s just annoying. I gave it 5 stars solely for the quality of material inside the book."
Amazon Customer,5.0,Makes learning Python easy and fun,"February,17,,2021","Admittedly I have a little bit of a computer science background, but programming has always been a challenge for me. I got this book after reading the positive reviews, hoping it would make my path to learning Python easier than my path to learning Java was (a nightmare). The concepts laid out in this book are logical and easy to follow. The explanations of code examples are clear. The exercises are useful and relevant. I've been working in this book for over a year and it was absolutely a great purchase."
DM,5.0,Best Python Starter guide I've ever seen!,"September,22,,2020","I've tried several courses before, but this book is the one that has, imho, the best explanations, the best presentation order of information, and the most useful concept order, too.  I highly recomment this one - I'm only 7 chapters in, but this experience will finally get me over the hump of all the other false starts I've had with Python prior to this.  Worth more than the $17, just go for it!  Oh, and I think that I could recommend this book to ages 15+, if there are any interested parties in that age group out there considering this one..."
Jonathan,4.0,Perfect for beginners - wish it was spiral bound,"January,25,,2020","I am taking an online college course for intro to scripting in Python, and there is no book with the course, just an online tutorial that you use. The online ""book"" is streamlined and wasn't cutting it for me. The Crash Course book is so much better and it fills in a lot of gaps. My only complaint is the book should have been spiral bound. The binding isn't great for a book this size and you need the spiral option to have the book stay open while you type in the exercises, which are great. Highly recommend the book for true beginners. Probably too basic for anyone else, but it is at the level i needed."
Stephen R. Roberts,3.0,Truely for the person that doesn't know how to program,"January,14,,2021","I write firmware/software professionally in C/C++/C#.  Recently I started learning Python and BASH.  Got this book to learn Python, the book was a bit long winded. If I was a newbie I'd want it to be wordy.,If you're a pro trying to pick up Python as new language in your arsenal, you'll have to read through a lot of fluff that you'd learn in your intro the programming classes in college.  The information isn't wrong, and the examples work, but....man...it's a long read.  I believe the book could probably be cut in half if the author removed the fluff.,Why the 3 stars?  Most books about learning have all the basics listed in a single chapter, so people with experience can just read it real quick and move on to the more complex ideas.  This book interweaves the basics through out the entire book, which for me was a mind boring read (IMHO)."
Amazon Customer,4.0,Good reference and beginner book - leave out the politics,"July,18,,2021","I bought this for class and it’s pretty dang useful.  It’s 99% non-political and just coding, but there’s definitely a push for making coding political in this book and his website. I just want to learn a new job"
CxegCfiJjXRfuN9,5.0,Worth Every Penny!,"February,10,,2020","Let me preface this review by saying that I have zero programming experience. I'm only four chapters into the book and I gotta say - Python is finally making sense to me! I've tried reading ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"" and I have no doubt that it's a good book. However, for me, it was not a good starting point and I found myself lost trying to read through the first few chapters - maybe I'll re-read ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"" afterwards after I finish ""Python Crash Course"". I'll do a follow-up review of this book when I'm done, but that won't be for a while; I'm going at my own pace and ensuring that I understand each topic and lesson. This book is worth the money if you want to learn Python!"
David L.,4.0,"Not bad, but some disappointment","June,25,,2019","The contents of the book are better than its manufactured quality.  Sadly, less than a week after receiving it, the cover came free of the rest of the book. It  was apparently only held on by two narrow strips of glue on the first and last pages, and no glue holding it to the actual spine!,The book contents itself are pretty good, but it does stay fairly simple. I bought the book because of the format of the examples, with code, point by point descriptions of the code elements, and then the output.  Some of the examples don't go very deep. I was looking at loop iterations, and the book really only covered using them with a print statement, though I was hoping for how to set variables and perform calculations according to current list value."
Jose Diaz,5.0,Great book to start off with Python!,"October,21,,2021",Good book to start off with learning Python. The book really walks you through how to make the commands work with examples and straight to the point explanations. Highly recommend as it as an easy to digest book and includes cool projects to apply the commands that you learn.
Nate Josephs,5.0,It covers Python in a very clear and straightforward way.  The hands on projects are great too!,"December,10,,2021",I liked the clear explanations of each topic.  The author explains what each line of code does which helps readers gain an understanding of Python easier.  The assignments further reinforced what was taught.
Mark Oglesby,5.0,Great book!,"March,14,,2022","Great book, taught me more than the college course I was taking."
rbsilva21,5.0,Best intro python book. Lots of hands on projects.,"February,20,,2020","I started to develop some projects in Python, following some internet web pages, everybody suggested this book for a beginner to intermediate Python student. The book provides tons of examples, the codes used in the book are in github as well if you got stuck in some examples, so is great to start thinking as a python developer. At the end of the book, there are 3 hands-on projects, a game to develop, a data visualization project and a web app using Django. I started with Django, I connected with my AWS account to use the web app in a cloud environment, so it gave me a lot of ideas to develop by myself using the book."
Joseph Hutchens,5.0,"Great book, Easy read and Easy to follow","September,11,,2021",This book is great for people who just learned Python or learned Python in recent years. Easy to follow and many projects to enjoy over the course of the read. The index is great for people who wants to jump around. I will recommend this book to others. Note: This book is not for kids.
Charlie L,4.0,First Python book,"November,1,,2021",Very basic contents. Great for beginners.
Helper,5.0,Great Explanations,"February,16,,2021","If you like to understand what each command does in Python then this book is for you.  A Python class can teach you how to write a project and as the project gets completed you get familiar with the different commands.  I prefer learning a programming language by learning the language commands first and then putting them together to write an innovative program.,If you like that too then this book is for you."
Gabi Q,5.0,Worth it,"July,19,,2021","This book is awesome. The author does a great job explaining new concepts and showing examples that make it easy to understand. As the material gets harder, the author does an excellent job at reintroducing concepts learned in previous chapters to help you write better code. I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone wanting to get familiar with Python."
Amazon Customer,5.0,Perfect for Tech-Challenged Python Learners,"August,7,,2020","I should start this review with the qualifier that I am extremely tech challenged. I've wanted to learn Python for a long time to help me with my work, but every book or course I had looked at previously was too quick, too advanced, and assumed you knew too much about programming and computers. This book literally starts with downloading Python correctly onto your computer - something I've had difficulty in the past with other programs! This book is perfect if you need a slow-and-steady introduction to Python with a lot of hand-holding and workable examples."
Lily,4.0,The contents are excellent!,"September,29,,2020","I have taken Learn Python the Hard Way online as well as codecademy. They both had its good and not so good, and I wanted to try this book. It was very complementary. The projects are great, easy to understand with detailed explanation. I took a start down, because of poor binding. They sent me a replacement with a different printing, but it was the same thing. Kindle version could be better."
Maintenance Man,3.0,Troubling at First,"October,9,,2021","I bought this book for the second half that has the projects. The first section was annoying because it was missing Pygame code that allows you to close the game window. Luckily I knew some Pygame and could fix it myself. I was going to give this book low marks for such a glaring oversight. However the second section with APIs was top notch. The last section attempted to cover way too much - Django, Bootstrap, Git, Heroku. Those topics could have easily filled a book on their own."
Bill L.,5.0,Just built my First Actual Django App,"August,21,,2021","I already knew quite a bit of Python and Flask, but never quite made the jump to Django. It's such a useful framework, especially the Database setup and Admin console are such a huge advantage over Flask. I haven't dug much into the other sections, but this section was worth the price alone."
Gino Murin,5.0,Perfect for beginners,"December,12,,2020","As a beginner programmer having very little knowledge, this book has done more for me in two weeks than any of the ""bootcamps"" or anything available online. The book goes in depth and gives you a good foundation in programming....Helps you to understand the underlying concepts and not just memorize code. Found this in numerous locations for free online but decide to purchase out of appreciation for what this has done for my development as a programmer. Highly recommend!"
MNorris,4.0,"Great content, but terrible binding and flimsy cover","June,10,,2020","They say don't judge a book by it's cover - and that's why I'm still giving it 4 stars. The actual content of the book is wonderfully written and explained. I really like that the author takes you through writing full game (like Space Invaders) using everything you have learned. I highly recommend it.,However the book binding has started falling apart after less than a month.  I plan on re-gluing the binding to make it a bit more sturdy."
Caner,5.0,This book can teach anyone how to code!,"July,10,,2021",I think I recently had a chance to review many Python books and this one has by far the most efficient organization that teaches you the basics of coding with solid examples. The second part of the book consists of useful projects in which you literally use any single knowledge you gain in the first part.
Dear MR.J,4.0,Good for beginner but does not go too far or deep,"June,29,,2019","What is good about it? It teaches you the basics of Python But it does not have any advanced materials inside.  Evey little example is well explained. It has a lot of examples are presented. It also asked readers to do exercises after concept.,However, I wish it comes with an answer for those after chapter exercises. Otherwise, it becomes meaningless because you won't know if you got it or not. Overall, well explained but somewhat too much explanation. Thus, this might be good for people who do not have any programming skill. Also, words are simple and straightforward.,Update: Thanks to the author reply, there are solutions online. But I still think it explained things too much. Thus, costed too much reading for a simple concept."
kdfuser,5.0,Very enjoyable read,"August,15,,2019","Just finished the book and followed the code all way, even did some of the ""Try this yourself"" exercises.  Very well organized.  6 stars on that.  Code in the book was accurate and worked as expected.  I didn't just try the code from the resource web site.  I actually typed in every line from the book and made it all the way to deployment.  (Quite an accomplishment, I say. :-)).,Only one gripe - see pictures attached.  After 3 weeks of ownership, the book lost its clothing.  :-(,I wonder if Mr Matthes will send me an autographed copy to replace my sad, broken, copy?  :-)"
Sam2013,5.0,"A great place to start learning python, regardless of prior knowledge in programming.","February,7,,2021","This book was amazing. Very easy to follow and understand. I think what I appreciate the most about it was the exercises that were frequently presented throughout the book. This gives you an opportunity to immediately practice the skills while they are fresh in your mind. The only way to really remember python syntax in my opinion is practice, so why not get started as soon as you learn it?"
Andrew,5.0,Very good python book !!!!,"February,10,,2022","Very good python book !!!!,Best python book.,Each step is very clear!!!"
Peanuts,5.0,Best python course.,"December,24,,2021",Easy to understand. Not bloated. This book will teach you Python programming. Its the best python beginner course that I have found.
Bob S.,4.0,"So far, so good - but terrible binding","July,14,,2020","I’m just getting into this book and am really enjoying it. The author provides easy to read / follow concepts and instructions. The book cover though? It broke before I made it to the Introduction of the book - literally 5 minutes of holding the book. I imagined using this book to take notes in and as a go-to resource, but my fear is it physically won’t hold up as I keep turning pages."
KB,5.0,It teaches python in the most explicted way for beginners,"November,18,,2021","The labeling is clean and organized, and it explains code in a very descriptive way, it's very a well-thought-out process, and it makes coding very self-explanatory overall I recommend this book."
Nicholas Broussard,5.0,Awesome Python Book,"October,15,,2019","This book is truly awesome. It teaches basic Python programming from the ground up. There's just the right amount of detail. I quickly became proficient at writing for loops, while loops, if-elif-else statements, and functions. The book is prefaced with nice explanations of the differences between lists, dictionaries, etc. I mostly loved the breakdowns of each example. The author gives a step-by-step explanation for each. This is clearer and more accessible than any other book I've seen.,My only request, Mr. Matthes, is that you write the same book but for R. I've waded through a handful of R books to find the info you've so succinctly made available in Python Crash Course."
agg_007,5.0,The best way to get started in Python!,"June,9,,2021","This book will take you from zero to hero (well on the path to hero) in Python!,It covers how to get started with the downloading process all the way to pushing your very own web application online!,I can't recommend this book, or any of the other Matthes books, more!"

Sheldon,5.0,Skills to Everyday Python Projects for Everyday Python Programmers,"April,30,,2021",I plain and simply love this book. I own both digital copies of the first and second edition. As an educator in technology this is on my recommended reading list for students wanting to learn Python. I work in the Net DevOps space and the material here can be translated to infrastructure monitoring. GREAT READ!!!

Beka,5.0,No need any previous knowledge in Python,"February,17,,2021","this book is amazing it is done in an excellent style, and you get knowledge step by step. There are so many exciting exercises that will give you self-confidence when you will find a way to solve it.,Projects at the end of the book are really nice introductions to start a more complicated coding."
kamgrn,5.0,10 stars!!,"December,7,,2019","I’m transitioning into a new role at work, and python is a requirement.  I wasted many hours on 2 udemy courses and a different python book.  Completely useless for a newbie to programming.  And then I found this book!  Lifesaver.  It literally walks thru everything step by step and is in a language that Makes sense and doesn’t have that techie over the head jargon. I would recommend this book to ANYONE wanting to learn Python. I will definitely be looking for other books by this author.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
Amazon Customer,4.0,Terrible binding!,"September,20,,2020",Book just arrived so I cannot comment on its content. Just wanted to confirm what others have said about the binding. You can already see the space between the cover and spine of the book. Maybe “no starch press” should change their name to “no glue press.”

Wesley preston,5.0,Damn fine,"March,5,,2021","I am in the process of using this book and I loved it. This is one of the few books I can actually read and understand everything that is happening. The few problems I did have, I looked up and the online forums had answers to all my questions. 5/5 programming book"

Theresa,4.0,A good start,"February,29,,2020","The book started off pretty easy and the author is true to his word about helping the student with questions as long as it is about something from his book.,I will say I found out though even though he book is meant for beginners and I am just a noob, I had some issues with sublime and found that using Anaconda much easier."
Brayden,5.0,print(this is a great book to learn python),"March,10,,2020",This book starts you from the basics from installing python to writing your first program. i am a good couple chapters in and i love how it’s written. everything is clearly explained with diagrams to help you troubleshoot your programs. it also has included projects that teach you while you make something. the book encourages you to experiment with what it’s teaching you to learn. it really is a great book to help learn python and i highly recommend it.
superthaix,5.0,The champion!,"March,12,,2020","Fantastic book, especially for beginners. Actually the best book ever to learn Python. Clear and easy to understand. Everything is explained very well. Just to let you know I have read at least 50 other Python beginners books, and this is the champion. The problem is that 99% of the beginners books are written by experienced programmers who are unfortunately horrible teachers. This book is the exception and gives you more confidence that you can actually learn Python."
Casey Sheehan,5.0,Learned so much!,"June,14,,2021","Have spent a couple of weeks plowing through this. It is extremely well written,  I've had no issue understanding any examples or instructions. Has taught me so much so far. Highly recommend for any one who doesn't know where to start."
Selina,5.0,very nice book to read!,"October,21,,2021",The author described the complicated things as easy to read. I read it every night and get a lot from it! Recommed!
Michael G. Myers,5.0,Very easy to learn,"November,13,,2020",Python was a new language for me.  I had programed primarily in C and then c#. Love python and this book is an excellent  introduction to python.  Every line of code for the projects is in the book and explained line by line.  I recommend it even  if you have no programing experience.
LoneStarBroker,5.0,Perfect,"December,20,,2021",Book is great! I am a happy camper.
jabari Webster,5.0,GREAT for ANYBODY!,"May,26,,2020",I bought this book to teach myself python after learning C++ and its very understandable and easy to read. Everything it teaches is clear and precise so if you are learning for school or self teaching I recommend this book! Its so good I logged onto my account a 3AM in the morning to write a review! FR though this is a good book you won't regret it.

JD,1.0,Very Politically Aligned Company,"June,16,,2022","I was excited to receive this book and begin reading the text. In the first chapter they provide two links to navigate to for additional information. The link directs you to reading how the US is racist. The website goes on to provide BLM support and information. This was very disappointing. I don't like to have politics shoved down my throat. I'll be returning this item and will look for another company to do my business with.,- ""It is abundantly clear in the US, and in many places around the world, that those who have power are desperate to hold on to that power, and are willing to use force - ""any means necessary"" is an all too common phrase - to hold on to that power. And that force is disproportionally, to a mind-boggling degree, used against Black people, Indigenous people, and anyone who can be classified as a minority."""

Even has you follow along with practices from within the book. I’m talking my first year of SD classes and this book is helping a lot with the python side of it."
cpbride,5.0,This is the book to get,"February,23,,2021",I have been trying to learn a python for five years using video courses. I decided to switch things up and try learning from a book. This is the book to get. I'm finally understanding concepts I have spent years trying to internalize.
MJS,5.0,"Content awesome, pacing awesome","March,4,,2020","The content of the book is great though I wish the font size was larger. The pacing of the course is perfect for me. No complaints regarding the content.,The lessons are in nice, bite sized chunks and work perfectly for me since I cannot sit down for long stretches but have to squeeze in some lessons and readings periodically over the course of the day.,<updated>"
Jared Meldrum,5.0,Great book!,"November,6,,2020",I got this book for some added material in one of my programming courses and it’s helped a ton! It’s a really good step by step guide and has you try a lot of the code on your own so you can see how it all works out
MB16v,4.0,No Starch Press with No Glue for the cover,"August,3,,2020",3rd day and the cover is already coming unglued. Hoping the content holds up.  Odd that the publisher is called No Starch Press....maybe they need to use starch to glue their book together.
Francisco Monzon,5.0,Really a very good book. Thank a lot.,"June,4,,2020","I recommend this Book. It is excellent to starting learning Python. Really was much better that I ever waited.  Just I suggest to add exercises more complex that need to be resolved with matters included in before chapters. Thank so much to the author, Eric Matthes. You should be very proud, cause really You did a very good job."
Makhmudjon Sobirov,5.0,"Didn't understand anything, but very interesting book","November,16,,2021","Didn't understand anything, but very interesting book"
Tolete,5.0,Excellent book!,"April,3,,2021",I highly recommend this book for those who want to learn the basics Python. It goes through great details and explains things very clearly with examples of what to do and what to avoid doing.
Carlos Salvatierra,5.0,Great book. Must read!,"February,4,,2021",Great book. It can be used for anyone with beginning knowledge. A must have book. Videos do not cover the pieces that the author covers here. I wish I had read this book a few years ago. Great job Eric!
Janet Fenstermacher,4.0,Very helpful with my class,"July,25,,2019","The only thing I have noticed so far is that the index pages in the back skip a few things. I believe a page was left out, I tried to look up integers and numbers, there is no M, N, and O in the index section.  Very detailed on everything I have looked up so far and I am very happy with the book."
Dio,5.0,Great starting material.,"November,1,,2020",Well worth the 20. Not sure if I'll stick with python though.. I've worked with Java before and I sucked. I'm giving python a try though. Liking things so far. I am looking forward to any python books the author has to offer in the future. Thanks.
M.Z.,5.0,Makes learning Python much simpler than any other resource I’ve tried,"April,13,,2020",I’m really impressed with this book. It breaks down the fundamentals into easily digestible and implementable pieces. The language is concise and the examples are easy to customize into something more meaningful to what I am trying to do. I’ve owned 3 other books on Python and took an undergrad course in it but this is by far the best resource I’ve used.
badmofo,5.0,Excellent,"May,2,,2021",Great book.  I’m on chapter 7 now and I am really happy with how the content is laid out in plain English and goes through each line of code step-by-step.
Shay,2.0,Don't buy this if you want to seriously code in Python,"December,22,,2020","This book has taught me again that not everything that is popular is necessarly good or even moderately good.,The pace is incredibly slow, like it was written for little children. The exercises are a joke - they don't make you *think*, they are very simplistic.,The thing that is most annoying is that every chapter he writes something like ""You will use lists when you, for example, want to write a game where you shoot aliens and want to remove aliens that were shot down"" when it is clear that you won't get anywhere near that level of programming ability by reading this useless book.,If you want a good book, don't go by what I say but go to the official python site at python.org and buy one of the books that they recommend for beginners. I bought the first book on the list and although the exercises are much harder it is by far a better book."
Molotov,5.0,Great content,"July,2,,2020","The book is well structured with useful examples to follow.  The focus is on best practices.  The exercises are semi-cumulative and galvanize the reader to think of the different ways a task can be accomplished.  If you put in a small amount of effort, this book will give you much in return."
Amazon Customer,3.0,"Good instruction, poor physical quality of the book.","February,8,,2021","The information and examples inside the book are excellent and I'm learning very much.  It's well written and everything is explained thoroughly for a real beginner like myself.  I didn't give it five stars because the binding of the book broke after a few weeks of normal use.  The book looks like its near new condition, but the binding is broken.  Kind of a pain to have to fix it after a short period of time."
Rory Derrick,5.0,Great resource for learning Python,"April,27,,2021","I have several ""no starch press "" books and have used them all for reference purposes. Python Crash course has covered many topics very well. I'm very pleased with it."
Jace,5.0,Great for learning python,"January,16,,2021",Tried taking online courses to learn python and hated that structure. This book is well written and easy to understand. Only had it for a week and can't put it down. Makes learning Python fun!
S.M.Simmons,4.0,This is a read an hands on approach book!,"February,7,,2020","Unfortunately I have to agree the glue at the base of the book, is not adhering to the pages.,Other wise great information, in a manageable, section read. That wants you to do the actual work. An not just read it."
Jacob,4.0,Don't judge a book by it's cover,"October,19,,2020","Content is really good. But as seen in other reviews, the glue holding the cover gives out and the cover falls off."
J,5.0,Great for starters,"February,13,,2021",So far so good. On the 5th chapter currently; the book is pretty straight forward and walks you through step by step. Would recommend for beginners with no previous coding experience.
Anthony Ortega,5.0,"Great book, love the content.","July,29,,2021","Just as I expected, learning programing is not a simple subject, yet author does a great work."
P. Camargo,3.0,"If your already developer, skip this book, it looks great for an absolute beginner","January,12,,2020","As a developer in other languages, this book was a little too beginner for me, it spends chapters going over basic data types, arrays (lists), things that anyone would already know if they've wrote code in other languages.  I don't mean to imply the book is bad, I imagine if I had no experience this is a great way to get into it, but I was disappointed when I read the introduction and it mentioned the target audience was a widespread target of people with no coding experience to college course students; reading that I knew and confirmed after some reading that it was going to have some painfully basic parts."
Pravin Pathak,5.0,Very good book to start learning Python.  3 complete projects from different fields,"May,10,,2020",Loved this book. Nicely explains basic concepts along with code. Each code line is explained properly.  Lots of code lines to explain.  Three projects at the end are really great way to enforce language and also to introduce different Python modules.  I found them really helpful.
Ahmed,5.0,A Magic book!,"March,22,,2021","Don't waste your time watching videos, stick with this book if you need to write a code. I wrote some code :),Thanks. Eric Matthes!"
Eva Frantz,5.0,Great new learning resource,"December,22,,2020","I agree with other commentors. Book binding is meh, but the content is great for a beginner. The book clearly walks through examples and exercises. Additional, the book teaches good coding practices!"
h20Lover,5.0,A must have,"November,12,,2019","I read the review before being this book and to be honest I was torn, however this book is 10/10 for me. Give it a try. It breaks down ""complex"" problems into direct and clear solutions. You don't have to go back and forth trying to catch up with his flow. I'm not even half way and I can super vouch for this book."
Out West,1.0,"Terrible Book - Wastes Time, Ink, Paper Codings Usless App's To Demonstrate Basic Stuff","June,5,,2022","Save your money!  Another terrible book that wastes good paper using 450 pages of the 500 pages to show reader how to build some stupid program to demonstrate usage.,I don't need to know how to code a list of cars, weather, scores, etc. The important thing is 'how to code a list' not, the all details that go into the list,Perhaps even worse is most everything Amazon delivers STINKS from Perfume/Cologne that rubs onto my hands.  I put this book into the Trash so quickly I almost tripped going out the door so fast to toss it...,It's no wonder Amazon no longer reveals internal pages in the Quick-Look!"

Turtleboi,3.0,Binding coming off,"June,29,,2020","Exctoed about the books content which I know will prob be great. But not hyped about the fact I can see the other side through the binding. Very annoying that I have to proactively buy book glue for a week or month from now when the cover comes off.,To get the Real cost of book you have to add $7-$11 for book glue.  Bought this thinking they fixed the binding with all the complaints,6/29/20"
Weronika,5.0,Go to book for Python,"July,12,,2020",This book finally helped me learned python after feel stuck and confused for months. It breaks it down and explains it beautifully. If you’re struggling with python on completely new to this then this is the go to book.

Brian. Vogel,3.0,Great For Introduction,"November,26,,2019","The 11 chapters of the book was very good at teaching python fundamentals. The examples were easy to follow and build upon. If I had stopped there, I probably would have given it 5 stars.,I decided to try out the Django section.  The author's choice to house the app learning_logs in a folder learning_logs made it very confusing, particularly when the folder name displays as learning_log$.  I frequently wasn't sure if I was in the correct directory when issuing python manage.py commands.  -2 stars for this."
Leon Schmidtman,4.0,Buy It,"December,27,,2019",Very good book. I highly recommend for beginners or advanced users that want an intro to Python. Is not too dumbed down or too hard to understand.

Jonathan A. Titus,1.0,AWFUL:  Sparse index makes info difficult to find info.,"October,21,,2020","The index in this book is awful so one star is the best I can offer.  Wish I could give it zero stars.  I have programmed in other languages and aimed to learn about Python so as a volunteer I could answer students' questions in a junior-high programming course.  The index is horrible and newcomers will find it difficult to locate important information.  As an example, the use of a loop in software lets a computer do something many times.  The word ""loop"" is not in the index.  That goes for """"else"" and ""elif,"" also important commands.  The entry labeled ""for loops"" points readers to a chapter labeled ""Working with Lists.""  Granted, this chapter includes information about loops, but you need to go to Chapter 7, ""User Input and while loops.""  The topic of loops should have its own chapter.  I need to find a better book and not one with half the pages devoted to games, data visualization, and web applications, which I have no use for. Revised 12-17-2020"

Schlermie,5.0,One of the Best,"October,29,,2022","I've been programming for over 40 years and programming Python intermittently for about 9. I’ve been through numerous programming books, college courses and online courses through the years, and this is one of the best. I picked up 𝘗𝘺𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘯 𝘊𝘳𝘢𝘴𝘩 𝘊𝘰𝘶𝘳𝘴𝘦 just for the section on writing & deploying Python web apps because I’ve never been able to get that to work, but this book was so well written, and I was picking up so many great tips, I ended up going through the whole thing from cover-to-cover. Now I’ve got multiple Python web apps deployed and working.,You don’t need any programming experience, and you don’t need a computer that’s preloaded with Python or a coding environment. All you need is fingers, eyeballs and a computer with Windows, MacOS or Linux. This book starts you from nothing, but if you go through every lesson, every exercise, every project and pay attention to the author’s advice, you’re going to come out a fairly decent software developer, capable of landing an entry-level software position. It’s fun too.,𝘗𝘺𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘯 𝘊𝘳𝘢𝘴𝘩 𝘊𝘰𝘶𝘳𝘴𝘦 starts you from nothing and walks you through the fundamentals of the Python language and popular modules. Then it ramps you up to building significant projects with step-by-step instructions. I had fun working my way through the project to develop a Space Invaders-like game. I haven’t written a game since I was a teenager. This book goes way beyond teaching you the Python programming language though. It coaches you through the many facets every software developer should know but might not know if you’re brand new to this stuff:,● Python installation to your computer (Windows, MacOS or Linux),● Sublime Text editor installation for coding (I used MS Visual Studio Code instead.),● Using Git for project version control,● Running programs from a terminal,● Commenting your code,● Styling your code,● Object oriented programming,● Using pip to download and install Python packages,● Importing and building modules,● Creating and using a Class,● Inheritance,● Decorators,● Exception handling,● Working with JSON and CSV data formats,● Using a web API,● Refactoring your code,● Testing your code with Unit Tests and Test Cases,● Planning a large software project and writing a spec,● Creating a game with Pygame,● Data visualization with Matplotlib and Plotly,● Writing web applications with Django,● Styling your web app with Bootstrap,● Creating and using a database with your web app,● User accounts and authentication in web apps,● Deploying your web app to Heroku so anyone on the internet can use it,● Writing secure code for use online,● Virtual environments,● How to think like a software developer,● Troubleshooting and debugging your code,● Getting help online through forums like StackOverflow when you’re stuck,● Text editors and IDEs,And this is just the second edition. I noticed the third edition of 𝘗𝘺𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘯 𝘊𝘳𝘢𝘴𝘩 𝘊𝘰𝘶𝘳𝘴𝘦 is coming out in January 2023 with updated code, practices and projects. If you want to learn about Python, or if you’re interested in learning to program from nothing, I highly recommend it."

So far, so good, I've had good references and bad.  Really not far enough along to provide a fully justified review of the material covered.,But after two days of using it, it is pretty shoddily made.  The cover has come completely off.  Not figuratively or virtually, but completely, as in the cover can go in one direction and the rest of the book in another.  Two days."
Charles La Fontaine,2.0,"Solid education, but poor construction","May,26,,2020","Great educational book. However, the quality of the construction on the book is poor. The cover on the book has completely torn apart from the adhesive and I’ve only studied from the book only a handful of times."

No Comps,1.0,Too basic,"March,23,,2022","The book lacks any depth or technicality whatsoever. The most basic coverage possible. Geared strictly towards the absolute beginner. If you have even the slightest knowledge of programming and/or python, this book offers virtually zero value."
Don,2.0,bought this a few days ago...,"June,4,,2020",I've read a little and the paper back cover has came undone... its very disappointing. nothing wrong with the content so far but having the cover come undone is just poor quality.
David A Patten,1.0,Single point of failure: pygame,"February,4,,2020","There are no clear instructions for how to install pygame. The first half of the book was great. But unfortunately, half the book was useless because it requires pygame. I followed the book verbatim: $ python -m pip install --user pygame and kept getting syntax errors. Python doesn't recognize $ as a valid input.  I googled around for solutions and got a variety of other errors. The author didn't seem to anticipate the magnitude of the problem if pygame couldn't be installed given his one line of instruction."

Don,1.0,Don't waste your money!,"May,6,,2020","A disaster from the getgo: on page 2 the author listed a requirement to download a 'sublime text' program, which froze my computer, requiring a reset and several hours reinstalling deleted programs. I never made it past Chapter 1, where he kept referring to 'hello_world.py', which I was unable to correlate to the 'print' command. He notes that a text editor is necessary, but doesn't provide any specific editor, such as PyCharm. Wouldn't recommend this to a compete novice, such as myself."

Joshua Hanson,5.0,From 0 to coder,"July,25,,2022","Having failed multiple times to learn to code, I tried again with this book and had a breakthrough!,It starts from absolute zero - how to get python on your computer, and how to start with an IDE to write your code.,The examples are helpful and plenty of exercises help to cement the new topics.,I have not reached the projects in the back of the book yet, but it is a fantastic book to self teach."

I ordered this book after and was able to learn the basics of Python very quickly. It has short exercises throughout the chapters that really help you practice, maintain and build onto your Python skills. It’s very well written and easy to understand. I purchased my book a while ago and have had no issues with it falling apart."
J.W.,1.0,OUT OF DATE,"November,1,,2020",out of date and NOT compatible with the latest iterations of the PYTHON language
Kevin Broderick,5.0,Great for beginners,"April,10,,2022","This book started my Python learning. I supplemented with online info as well as used a mobile app and online learning course.,Understand; programming can be hard but like anything, if you do it every day, you will love it. Don't force yourself and remember to take breaks. This book will get you into it!"
LoneWolf,5.0,Really good for learning Python. Well written and easy to follow examples.,"March,24,,2022","This book if taken seriously will ingrain the basics into your head. The book might be for python beginneers but there is a lot to cover and many excercises to do. I am an intermediate level C programmer and  compared to C, python is incredibly large but fun to learn.  This book covers everything to get you going to more intermediate level programming."
Amazon Customer,5.0,Book is great,"March,31,,2022","I love the breakdown of code fragments for tighter explanation.  I do wish the index was better, but this book will make you competent."
MUSTAFA OZGUR KILICARSLAN,1.0,So so,"September,12,,2020",So so
Sophie Crash,5.0,Hands on learning in the paperback book,"July,29,,2021","I wanted a new hobby I can do from home. I’m a total beginner, even needed the instructions on how to open the command prompt! So I’m definitely learning a lot already. The book is really long, like a textbook, but since it is a paperback it is not so heavy. I really like the texture of the cover, it isn’t glossy like most textbooks. I like that the content in the book gets hands-on almost right away. The book is perfectly up to date and the programs it requires are also free."
Dan Hanson,4.0,"Python, yes but the skills apply to other languages","June,3,,2019","Edition 2 is cleaned up and better organized and focuses on Python 3 only (no reason to learn Python 2 anymore.)  While it uses Python to teach you to code it also teaches clean programming skills that apply to most other languages.,The book is neatly broken down into two parts.  The first half focuses on installing and using the Python language.  It teaches using data, whiles, ifs, loops, accepting user input for interactivity – all the basic programming stuff.,The second part features three projects: a video game (like Space Invaders), data visualization techniques to make graphs and charts, and an interactive web application.,The book lists other online resources and has a well thought out Table of Contents and Index.  Appendix A covers installation issues and troubleshooting on various platforms.  Appendix B covers Text Editors including more on the recommended Sublime Text editor and Integrated Development Environments (IDE). Appendix C gives resources and ideas to take your coding beyond the book. The final Appendix shows how to use Git for version control in your programming.,It’s a great resource and not a surprise that so many copies have sold.  Recommended."
Erik T.,4.0,Absolutely NOT SUITABLE for experienced programmers!,"July,27,,2019","This book came recommended in several searches on ""Best Python Book for EXPERIENCED programmers"". Simply put, while this book appears quite well written for complete novices who have never programmed in another language before, it's absolutely not suitable for experienced programmers who seek to learn Python.,I came expecting the first chapter to give me some clarity on the pros and cons of Anaconda vs. direct install of Python, which libraries were most essential, and advice on which of the several Python IDEs might best suit my circumstances. Instead I found a long section introducing the concept of what a text editor is, and an entire chapter introducing the concept of what a variable is.,I gave it 4 stars because the problem was with the advice I received, not with the author, who seems to have done an excellent job of writing a book for people with zero programming experience. For anyone else who shares my objectives, further research revealed that FLUENT PYTHON is probably the best book for those who have prior programming experience in other languages."
Steven,5.0,The Absolute Best for Learning Python,"May,20,,2021","Pros:,I have done so many different free online courses, but this book is by far the best. Be sure to actually utilize the ""TRY IT YOURSELF"" sections. In PyCharm, I have a ""Crash Course"" directory with each chapter in a subdirectory. Each assignment is a module. Do these and you will definitely learn from them.,Cons: The book is starting to fall apart. If needed, I will take it to FedEx Kinkos and turn it into a 3 ring book."
natalia c,5.0,Enseña desde lo básico y muy bien explicado,"July,1,,2021","Después de tener muchos problemas con libros y tutoriales que ""asumen"" que sabes ciertas cosas de programación, este libro fue una grata sorpresa. Me ENCANTA la forma en que están estructurados los temas y la buena explicación del autor en cada uno de estos."
Taylor,5.0,"GREAT for beginners- Simple, clear, and easy to understand.","May,15,,2019","## Allow me to preface by saying I’m only 5 chapters in and will update my review if need be if my opinion changes.,Going into this I have tried learning python through other books and online courses but always struggled keeping everything straight and understanding how the code actually worked. Sometimes I feel that Python is so easy to write it’s hard to understand exactly what you’re even doing if you have no other language experience. So I actually spent a few months learning Java to understand the basics since Java sort of holds your hand in how you have to write so much more out like declaring every variable. I picked up this book to try and get back into Python and so far I’m LOVING this book. The author does a great job explaining what you need to know and nothing more. Straight to the point while still explaining each like of code very clearly. I’m excited to get to work on the project(s) later on in the book. If I still like it I will most likely order the publishers other Python book about “automating the boring stuff”."
John Smith,5.0,Superbly written! Takes you from Hello World to Classes to Error Handling and much more!,"May,12,,2020","The book is very nicely organized with all the usual ""Installation"" chapters at the end of the book in an Appendix.  If I said that this is THE BEST BOOK ON PYTHON currently (May 2020), I won't be exaggerating at all. I ordered (and unfortunately returned) a few of the Python books until I found this one. Along with the,book, this is one of the best books currently available if you want to learn Python.,I have been using Python for the past 5 years for automating infrastructure deployment on AWS, mostly with Lambda, but I don't consider myself a Python developer. This book not only covers all the basics for the beginner programmer but also gives a comprehensive yet concise introduction to object-oriented programming concepts and how they are used in Python. What got me to give it 5 stars was the later chapters that discuss the various projects from Games and Data Visualization to Web Application.,If you have to buy just one book on Python, this should be it!"
Angela,5.0,"Finally, something that makes sense","September,17,,2019","I have been trying to learn to code off and on for years and years. This is the first resource I've tried that actually helps me understand what I'm doing. I got it quite a while ago and got to the Dictionary section, I think. Then I lost interest. I started in on it again maybe a week ago because I'm trying to become employable. I started from the beginning and I'm almost to Dictionaries and I'm doing pretty well with it.,The pacing is perfect for me and I love how things are explained. I think there was one time when something wasn't clear, but maybe I'm just dense.,I see some people have had problems with the quality of the book. Mine has been in my backpack and hauled out in cafes several times and flipped through on a bookstand quite a bit. I have 2 other No Starch Press books and the quality on those are great as well, so it seems there's a bad batch on the loose.,So yeah, loving this book so far. I wish I had it 10+ years ago."
merchant,5.0,Eric deserves a prize!,"April,28,,2020","Let me say that I have tried my hands at programming many times. I started with C, C++, Java, etc. years ago.,Most books were dry and provided so many details that would overwhelm an average beginner like me. I would quit after spending time as I would lose confidence and had to move on with other life problems that came along. I didn't see myself spending more time, as I knew I would fail to complete.,Not this book, however. Eric explains each concept in a simple, easy to understand manner. Through his examples, he keeps readers aware of how and where they can apply to the concept just learned, and his Try it Yourself exercise goes an extra step in solidifying the concepts.,Programming is hard, but one can learn and master, I feel,  if you have a teacher like Eric, or read this book.,Eric, a big thank you! You let me achieve a goal, I always wanted to, ""To program and solve real-world problems."""
Oliver,5.0,excellent,"August,7,,2021",love it
dc rogers,4.0,Is Monty Aware?,"October,17,,2019","A great book to start learning python from scratch. I am hands on and thos book explains how things work, why things work, and allows you to put things into practice. It even touches on django, api, and python for web dev briefly towards the end and opens doors to so many other avenues. I do recommend and also to follow up with impractical python projects and/or automate the boring stuff by the same publisher."
PGM,5.0,Excellent beginner book on python,"December,7,,2020","You can learn python on your own with this book.  I have followed it page by page and am writing python programs.  I have had very few problems understanding what is written or expected in the ""try it yourself"" sections.  It is logical and orderly.  My sister and a friend are also learning python using this book and they feel the same. None of us have had prior programming experience. I am almost half way through the book. It was definitely worth the purchase (my company purchased this book for me from Amazon)."
Eduardo g.,5.0,!!!!!! READ !!!!!!,"October,2,,2020","If you are like what I was a few months ago! Like did not know any programming language like, Not no one drip of coding like NOTHING!!! This book will really help you. Seriously. I actually sent the author a thank you email and he actually replied which was cool. But because of python I picked up java really quick. Because of this book GUI was such an easy thing to learn and if you're like me ""GUI"" just scared you like what the F is that well don't worry this book will give you literally every tool you'll need even ones you won't. Do yourself a favor get it!"
Homayoun Birangi,5.0,One of the best Python programming books,"February,13,,2020","As a C++ programmer that knew a little bit about Python, I started reading this book on weekends. The books is so clear in explaining the subjects at hand that makes me wondering how much effort and patient the author has put in writing the book. After explaining the basics in the first few chapters, more advanced topics such as Classes, Inheritance and Files are explained. The second half of the book covers 3 projects. I learned more doing the 3 projects than anything else. I wish the author writes another Python book with more advances topics. I will buy one."
Z,5.0,A terrifically written guide for absolute beginners.,"May,29,,2020","I've tried to learn to program several times in the past and always quit because the learning curve always seemed too difficult.  This book is so well written, everything is perfectly explained. I'm super impressed.  I'm only 100 pages in  but I've learned so much. I sent some code i'd written to a friend of mine who works at NASA, he was impressed to hear that i'd only been learning Python for 2 weeks. This book is a beginner's course in Python written by a terrific teacher. Highly recommended."
Dr. Stephen S. Hamilton,5.0,Very Comprehensive Book,"January,4,,2020","I received this book as a gift, and found it to be extremely well written.  It contains lots of sample code and detailed explanations of what that code is doing.  The ""Try It Yourself"" section at the end of each chapter allows the reader to try their hand at programming.  Finally, the second part of the book features three comprehensive projects to reinforce all the skills learned earlier.  Overall, a very good book ... for someone with a little prior programming experience."
Eric G. Reyes,5.0,"Good book, excellent author, very responsive and genuinely cares for newbies.","January,19,,2021","This is actually my 2nd introduction to Python.  As a newbie, ran into a problem immediately. Emailed the author and was pleasantly surprised for an immediate response and advise.  Author seems to genuinely care for newbies like me."
xyz,5.0,You won’t regret it,"June,8,,2020","Level: Beginner,I’m coming from the iOS background, and I learned Python when I was in the school, and now learning Python for fun, and let me tell you one thing, this is the best Python book out there. I mostly love the breakdowns of each example. The author gives a step-by-step explanation for each.,This book includes Basics and 3 projects (will look good on your resume)."
Amazon Customer,5.0,Add Python to PATH,"June,27,,2019","I am a beginner programmer. In my first python installation, I had omitted to select Add Python 3.7 to PATH in the installer, the hello_world.py file in Chapter 1 could not work, and it’s frustrating and worrisome to troubleshoot for a beginner.,Luckily, I had found the author Eric’s email, and over a few days period, he had patiently troubleshooting for me and eventually discovered the omission.,I am grateful to him and thank you for your kind assistance and patience, Eric. Many thanks! 🙏"
Isaac Barrow,5.0,Rating for 1st Edition,"May,31,,2019","As a decent programmer in other languages, I bought the first kindle edition of this book to learn python 3 from scratch. I found it to be excellent with clear, step-by-step explanations and practice exercises - haven't got to the projects yet. I am sure that even someone with zero programming knowledge would benefit.,I do wonder though if the changes in the second edition are worth the additional investment. That is hard to tell since Chapter 2 is not included in the preview."
RAUL VELEZ,5.0,Amazing book to learn python,"April,8,,2020","The way this book is structured and the amount of examples and exercises that it has, really helps you to learn Python efficiently. In addition to this, the projects that it has , allows you to consolidate your knowledge with hands-on and fun projects.  I strongly recommend this book for those that are interested in learning Python."
Joseph J. Pedalino,5.0,Great Book to start Python Programming,"September,23,,2020","Easy to follow and the concepts are immediately followed with examples and ""Try it Yourself"" exercises so you won't have to refer too far back for the theory. Small programs make it easy to follow the concepts and the exercises build on the concepts. Great book to have as a reference on your bookshelf."
Sharon,5.0,Great book if you know nothing.,"December,14,,2019",Really enjoying this book. Helps you set up a work environment with free software to get started with.

RonLev,3.0,"Some essential things are missing here,","April,26,,2020","First admission:  I didn't buy the book.  Because?  I checked the index and there is nothing on pandas or numpy, two of the most popular and important packages.  In 500+ pages you couldn't squeeze these into the book?"
Robert V.,1.0,Trivial examples and exercises,"July,7,,2019","Of all of the things I've used to learn Python over the past 2 years, this book was the absolute worst. I think it's popular because it gives people a false sense that they understand the material, but all it does is set you up for failure when you try and do something that is slightly different from one of the examples in the book. As an example of what I mean, the book spends pages talking about how to create a list of favorite pizza toppings (something that should really take a couple of lines of explanation), and then there is an exercise to create a list of your favorite places in the world. Now if you know no Python, and I say this is a list of pizza toppings in Python, I would argue that you could probably give me a list of favorite cities in Python without ever having the slightest idea of what a Python list is. Pepperoni....let's replace that with Denver.........Meatballs.....you're now New York. It would be one thing if this was just the introductory exercise on lists and the exercises then progress to get more difficult. But this is literally true of every exercise in the entire book."
Old Sub Sailor,1.0,I can not recommend this book. It falls short in teaching what is used.,"August,10,,2021","HOMEBREW USERS you already know terminal and the command line. You can download Homebrew Python and not bother with Python.org.,Needs more attention and detail with regard to the command line interface and what actually should have been typed, i.e. page 7 & 228.  Matthes fails to tell people not to enter the terminal prompt symbol $ as part of the input; nor does he discuss what a terminal prompt is.,Sublime text should have been avoided if at all possible, for Mac users, use the free forever Textwrangler.,I was following the book and went to the no starch website to review the resources. Unfortunately Matthes went political there and in a most unfortunate manner."
Tony,2.0,"Good and Easy Learning, Formatting is Wanting","June,4,,2021","The substance and the way Python is taught is easy to understand and intuitive. It’s a good place to start for someone like me who have zero coding knowledge prior.,The only issue… The sample codes are near impossible to figure out because the formatting on kindle is so horrid. Not sure if this is due to the book itself or the transfer to Kindle. I had to google and use github to get through some of the codes."
Mikey A.,2.0,Great book! But where do i download the ship from in the AlienInvasion project?,"May,22,,2021","I tried to go to resources in the link that's shared in the book, but couldn't find anything."
RoBe,1.0,Show me updated preface,"May,8,,2019",Not a chance I will purchase the book when I can't even read the Preface to the new edition using preview functionality. What is the point of preview if I can't see what differentiates this book from previous edition?
Kindle User,1.0,Hard to Follow. Poor Explanations.,"June,16,,2020","In case you are looking for text to learn Python from scratch, just look else where. This author himself needs to learn it in the first place."
alrightalrightalright,5.0,So good,"January,30,,2022","I am about 8 chapters into this book. So, I haven’t finished it yet, but I wanted to give my thoughts so far.,I had been hesitant to try to learn programming. I am an adult learner, and I was scared that it was complicated and hard. Other methods I had tried (YouTube videos, Udemy courses, iPhone apps) didn’t teach me things I felt I needed to know as a complete beginner. So I gave up each time. I still had so many questions, and not the kinds of questions you want to have as a beginner. Usually it’s a bunch of “why’s” or “how’s”. I would get discouraged and give up, because how could you advance when you’re really not even sure what you’re doing in the first place?,I recently got the itch to try again. I have always known about this book, so I came back to it first. I am SO glad I did.,I can’t remember the last time I was so impressed with a non-fiction book. The information here is intelligently structured, expertly delivered, and easy to digest. Every time I feel like I have a question (one of the why’s or how’s), I suddenly find that the question is being answered almost at the same time as I am asking them. It makes you feel like the author is a bit of a mind reader.,I’ve been progressing really well by going through this book. I do no more than one chapter per day so that I have time to digest, then come back to the next chapter which builds upon the last - forcing you to practice what you’ve already learned. I can’t believe I find myself easily spitting out some of the code, and even incorporating what I’ve learned in ways that the book hasn’t gotten to yet. Oops?,For anyone who might read this review, I have a couple of suggestions…,1. Don’t worry about what computer you have, and don’t worry about setting up a developer environment yet. Start by using a cloud-based IDE like Repl.it. It’s free. It is SO easy to use. It gives “hints” to complete your code, as well as what to fix when something is wrong. It also has built-in shortcuts to help you code a little faster - some of them I’m still learning.,2. Get the book spiral bound for $6 at Staples. I hate when books won’t lay flat, especially when I’m so actively using them. Now that mine is spiral bound, I can easily go back and forth from book to computer without worrying about the pages flipping on me. I also don’t need a bookmark anymore. I just leave the book open to where I left off.,To the author:,My only wish is that the exercises, or “Try this” sections, were a little more structured at the beginning to reinforce some of the lessons. Since I’ve reached chapter 8, I find myself wishing I had just sat down and practiced writing list after list, then dictionary after dictionary (as an example), etc. The subtle differences are everything in programming, and even though I know I will catch on with more experience, I would feel more confident if I had them down a little more at this stage.,Final notes:,After 8 Chapters, I already found myself looking for other books by the same author so I could continue building on what this book teaches me, knowing that I was in good hands. Sadly, this is the only book this author has done on the subject, but I feel fortunate to have it."
Gavriel,5.0,The best textbook I have ever read; bar none,"October,28,,2021","I'm a computer scientist from a family of teachers, professors, and IT specialists; I don't know how many people realize how rare it is to have someone qualified to write a textbook, who has a balanced enough perspective to understand a students generalist foundation without being demeaning; this book is written in a way that briefly answers why, where someone would think ""why this, not that"", addressing common issues preemptively with solutions to avoid losing the trust of the student.,This textbook is easier to learn from than most of my professors, and this book would have been far more pleasant an introduction to programming than the Java class offered by the college, not to mention the Java textbook; that can't even compare."
Nicholas Andresen,5.0,"A great way to learn programming, not just Python","June,17,,2022","This is the first book I used to learn Python, before I had any experience programming. While it is a thick book, the many examples and well-paced walkthrough from the basics to importing modules and creating a 2D game are great resources to gain comfort and muscle memory for writing code. This book helped me gain a foundation in code that prepared me to learn other programming languages like Javascript, C++, and C#. Overall, this would be a great first book for those interested in learning to code."
ARad,5.0,Very good book for beginners or people with some previous background,"August,21,,2021","I purchased this book to add to my programing knowledge . I studied Visual Basic back then in when i used to go to school. Coming from VB programming, this book was extremely easy to follow. The author has real life examples for everything you learn in the book. I definitely recommend this book even over video courses. after reading 8 chapters I am able to write very basic programs that works."
Dirkster,5.0,Great book for beginners,"January,5,,2022","I started learning Python with online app courses, but noticed they tend to have learning gaps.  Started going through this book, and it's great.  Takes the time to explain why you do certain things in Python, as well as show good examples.  The exercises are step by step, and so far I've had no issues.  The only challenge I've had so far is working with and learning how to use text editors.  I recommend Visual Studio Code over what is recommended in the book."
Amazon Customer,5.0,Great Read,"January,18,,2022","Honestly? I’ve learned a lot. I’m taking a course on Udemy, watching YouTube videos, using every resource I can and this book just puts things in a way you can really understand and practice. My book came with its spine in tact(it still is),10/10 would highly recommend.,Will be buying their more advanced books in the future as well as the flash cards."
RJA,5.0,Easy to learn,"August,4,,2022",This is exactly what I was looking for.  Easy and interesting method of learning python3.  Highly recommended for those starting out or have not touched python for awhile.
Alina Kostina,5.0,Recommend it for beginners,"November,13,,2021","I recommend it for beginners! Eric Matthes showed and explained every step in python. It helps me not to give up and learn more about programming. If you want to start a new career, this book will help you!"

meadows_hands,5.0,This helped after so many failed attempts!,"February,26,,2022","I am 10 days in and can't believe how fast I'm picking this up! I've tried probably ten times to learn how to code and gave up after entering ""tutorial hell"".,This book is simple and straightforward. I'm writing programs and having a lot of fun. Wish I would've gotten this book sooner!"
acupsf,5.0,Not really a review,"August,10,,2021","Rather a typo report: In the title ""...: 2Nd edition"" -- 'N' should be lower case, right?"
alex,5.0,Good reading before the book itself falls apart!,"September,5,,2020","Content is good and easy to understand.  Suitable for a beginner like me.  BUT! ""No Starch Press"", the publisher of this book ought to change their name to ""No Glue Press"" as the book has started to come apart.  Did not even get to Chapter 4 when it unbound!"
Rozz Yobb,5.0,This book has my recommendation.,"May,19,,2021",This book is lit.  Great for a beginner or if you’re an intermediate user brushing up on skills.  The projects are great for a beginner and even some challenges for a programmer who is not a newbie to python.  The author of this book has a few great YouTube videos as well.
John Doe,1.0,Errors in code and pushes his political views to reader.,"June,24,,2022","This book would of been perfect if it weren't for errors in coding and pushy political views. In a book meant to help children, teens, and adults learn python; there's no need for politics."
J. A. Grogan,5.0,Comprehensive and long Python Crash Course book,"August,15,,2022","Comprehensive and long Python Crash Course book. It's good for me but then I'm an experienced programmer and administration. I think it would be OK for a real beginning programmer too, but working through a book by rote is not going to really prepare them to be a good programmer. They'll learn python though."
Diana Rojas,5.0,Very interesting book,"November,13,,2020",I learned alot from every page of this book
JManInPhoenix,5.0,Excellent intro into Python,"August,23,,2021","About halfway through the book now - in the middle of the alien invasion project.  Book is very well written - it explains all the basics with just enough detail to understand but not overboard with too much.  I recommend getting both the hard copy and e copy of the book as I found the e copy to be very helpful to look at when I have Visual Studio Code open and working on a file.,Highly recommend to anyone wanting to learn the basics of Python!"
Chris,5.0,This book is great,"May,17,,2021","I'm learning so much from this book. It's slow going because I don't have as much time to spend on it as I'd like, but it walks me step by step when I do have a few spare minutes to learn code."
Ned Givens,5.0,Great instruction for learning Python,"March,20,,2022",Read and learn Python as I am studying Data Analytics. Have my newly bought Samsung tablet next to my laptop to work the examples. I am very pleased with this book. I highly recommend it.
RA Wolfe,5.0,Great Refresher too,"August,21,,2021","I bought this because I had stopped paying attention to python before version 3 and so was rusty.,this is a great book to refresh your skills, not just for beginners."
Ryan,5.0,Easy to Follow,"August,20,,2022","The bad first; I had to get a replacement book. NOT because of shipping issues, because the back cover was smaller than the pages. The pages overlapped the back cover and the pages were getting hit on every surface I sat the book on. The replacement came in and it's beat up as well, which could have been shipping. At least the pages are fine. Since that's not the content I can't take away stars for a quality assurance issue.,The good; the book starts out as if you have no prior programming experience. Intermediate programmers this may not be the primer you're seeking. It's very high level, no real granularity to get you in the ground programming.,The odd; the author pushes the use of Sublime Text and then bounces from terminal to editor. The editor isn't an issue, but it's not free, it just contains an untimed trial. A license is $99(that's USD) which isn't worth it for a hobbyist. I'm not going to push off an editor or IDE, but there are dare I say better alternatives.,The WTH; I had seen reviews talking about politics 🙄 the two hyperlinks given at the beginning of the book are the authors github and the publishers website. Can't we grow up, if someone has a different view than you does that change the content? We can have different opinions and still like each other. The content is fine.,TL;DR: be careful book may arrive damaged. The content is great for the ABSOLUTE BEGINNER. I have yet to see the political views that some people are leaving poor reviews for."
Amazonian,5.0,"Five Stars for content, Zero for Binding","August,12,,2020","Outstanding book that's well laid-out and absolutely perfect for learning or brushing up on Python.  The binding, however, is awful.  After only a couple of days of reading, the binding has completely separated from the spine (see photo).  So while the quality of the content is first class, the binding is strictly economy.  Fortunately, the paperback is only 17 bucks.  Much more than that and I would have requested a replacement."
Mr.Martin,4.0,Crash Course,"May,31,,2021",Purchased these book for my boy to get self knowledge  on the pc technology and beyond
Thomas Veach,5.0,Learn Python.,"July,17,,2021",Very well edited for ease of use. Text is easily read. Good feedback lessons to allow the user to test learning.
Youness Alqoh,5.0,Very helpful,"November,30,,2020","Very helpful and its very famous book,Its perfect book to start with"
Eric J.,5.0,Very nice book!,"May,7,,2020","This review is for the printed version of the book; I have not seen the kindle version.  I am an experienced developer, but brand new to Python.  After buying, and in one case returning, several kindle books on Python, I still hadn’t found one which I felt did a first-rate job of presenting the material.  Then I bought the “Python Crash Course” book.  I’m only on Page 130, but so far the book has exceeded my expectations.,The layout is sensible and very professional, the examples are instructive, and the exercises are as much fun as you can have when trying to learn a new programming language.  As several others have noted, you might want to order a tube of glue when you buy this book; the cover started falling off after about Day 2.  I’m not going to knock off a star for a problem like that, but it is a bit annoying.  So, if you want to learn Python, I can highly recommend this book to get you started."
Ariyo Omolade,5.0,The Book that hand-held me into programming,"September,20,,2021","This book took me fron ground zero to a more knowledgeable python programmer. I learnt pretty much alot about working with file, data visualization, classes, methods, functions ect. I highly recommend this book as the first book to study when venturing into python programming. Thought the quality of binding of the book needs to be worked because after rigorous reading the book falls apart. But is a must read for any beginner."
Shahzad Khan,5.0,A good refresher,"October,19,,2020",I like it end to end
Gouthami,3.0,Good book to start but not who want to become a gem in python,"July,28,,2020",Good book to start the python course but needed more detailed explination. The assiagnment given as try it yourself is good way to learn but how can i know iam i doing the right or wrong the answer should given back of the book so we can learn easily.
Amazon Customer,5.0,great book,"December,13,,2019",excellent material arrived quickly!
Louis,5.0,Super helpful!,"April,13,,2020",I learned c++ in college but didn’t practice any after. I recently got back into coding and wanted to learn python...great language to start with. This book is the best book you can buy to learn python. The flow is great. The mini assignments build off each other. I’m constantly going back to the assignments to practice and I try to complete them in a different way each time. Buy this book.
Tekdif,5.0,Practical application,"July,13,,2020","I purchased this book and prime delivered as they always do in 24 hours since it was a small item and ""in stock"",I chose this particular python book for two reasons.,1) It is one of the higher rated python books for beginners (over half a million sold).,2) While your moving along learning the language, the authors include projects that are ""Practical"" so you can apply what your learning.,Not much else to say. If you go through this book you will have a foundation of python (something to stand on).,Ps. I spilled coffee the first hour into this book. lol It only hit a few pages and all is fine."
Amazon Customer,5.0,Easy to use,"September,13,,2019",I use it as a reference or as continuous reading.  It's a lot of pages but it's not too heavy to read.
Vittorio A.,5.0,,"December,30,,2022",I've almost never studied informatic nor code language and this book is a fantastic starter. It explains you everything and you can follow step by step every explanation because you try to code everyting you learn. Very good and after the first section of the book there's a second one that goes deep in coding and explain to you more complex stuff and even create your own game or other complex tasks.
Parveen Parveen,5.0,,"December,29,,2022","Very good book,No scrathes everything perfect"
Abhinav,5.0,,"January,9,,2023","This is the best book to learn python for beginners. For best results, study a topic daily and practice the TRY YOURSELF exercises twice"

Ibrahim,4.0,,"October,17,,2022","Learning programming is hard alone but trying to learn programming from reading is a pain far from imagination. Fortunately this life saver was very easy to understand and beginner friendly, however the write had one downfall he failed to provide alternatives for windows users in the command line"
Amazon Customer,5.0,,"November,11,,2022","A good book for providing an introduction to Python with some useful exercises. I have gone on to purchase further books by the author, who also has a course on Udemy. valuable"
Paul Westeneng,5.0,,"October,14,,2022","About 30-40 years ago I was a C programmer and did a lot of other things since.,I wanted to pick up Python. This book helped me a real lot. It was a great learning aid and after a few year I still use it as a reference doc."
Dave,4.0,,"June,8,,2022","Still getting into Python - using several online sources  and books.,This one needs work to get into the subject.,Found flowcharting the problem to get a clear solution  - then concentrating on the code works well. This approach is not well presented in the sources I am using,Also found that if you step back and look at the code  - there are sequences, decision points, loops and subroutines. This helps to get the code  layout - indents sorted,Onward!,Update. Starting to appreciate the work done to produce this book. Into the first Game Project. Used link to the resources at nostarch Internet site . Slow going - a good experience. Onward!"
Amazon Kunde,5.0,,"October,20,,2022",Best Python book for beginners! + Python Distilled is needed
Tom,5.0,,"September,16,,2022","Easy to follow, everything explained in perfect detail. Definitely a great starting point if you are just getting into coding. Book sets you up with alot of knowledge and you can definitely start building small yet meaningful projects upon completion.,I would recommend skipping the Django/Pygame projects at the end though. Use a more up to date tutorial, since these modules have been updated since this book was published (not alot, but still)."
Calgary maman,5.0,,"November,12,,2022",Great starter book if you're tackling Python with little coding experience.  Only blip is the cover unglues from the book. I'd trialled a copy from my local library first and same problem. The problem isn't with Amazon.
Trajano Bertrand Llera Romero,5.0,,"October,25,,2022",Vary easy to learn Python language with this book. I love it
Kristian Martin,5.0,,"September,25,,2022",This book is great if you have no previous coding experience.
J SIMPSON,5.0,,"May,11,,2022","I like the format (specific lines given numbers so detailed explanations of each part can be explained clearly and simply ) and the no nonsense dive into each aspect is in useful. Not only does it give you lots of examples and exercises to do at every stage but (I'm only 50% through it yet) the examples also include typical mistakes so you learn what to look out for. Which is invaluable to a python programmer just starting out.,It will be a valauble reference. All too often I've found texts and videos either throw you in the deep end expecting you'll figure it out or keep you forever in the paddling pool. The book itself is a nice size and good quality print. I'll definitely be checking out other books in the series."
Giorgos,4.0,,"July,26,,2022","As suggested by the ""crash course"" title will get you started fast in comparison to others and it will do it quite methodically. You will not go deep or in detail and the examples and exercises are on the easy side."
MR. D. S. P. TUSON,5.0,,"June,20,,2022","This is well written, presents the information in an easily readable and comprehensible style, and covers a range of material that is broad enough to provide a good foundation to start tackling practical tasks. As with any book aimed at this level, it will bring the user (you need to do the coding of course, and not just read the words) to a fair level of independent capability, so that with a mindset of being willing to carry on working out how you do things with Python, you would be ready to build your experience without too much of a struggle. I recommend this book highly."
Bijay shaw,4.0,,"July,20,,2022","Very good book for beginners...,Recommended for all beginners.👍👍,But the binding of the book is not good.."
Sebastián,5.0,,"July,22,,2022","Llevo años queriendo aprender Python y al fin decidí comprar este libro para tener una guía más estable a la hora de aprender. Se cubren conceptos básicos de programación, aparte de que la forma en la que se enseñan el lenguaje es rápida pero concisa, de modo que pasas por muchos temas rápidamente pero comprendiendolos gracias a las excelentes explicaciones. El tamaño del libro es perfecto para leerse con facilidad en un escritorio junto a una computadora, a esto se le suma que la tipografía es muy fácil de leer."
DBarnett,5.0,,"August,11,,2022","This book is an ideal introduction to Python. It sets out important concepts in a logical manner, and explains the details very clearly. While I haven't got to the three projects yet, I can certainly recommend the 'Basics' section that covers the building blocks of the language."
Gabriela Mendes,4.0,,"May,6,,2022","Eu já tenho conhecimento em programação, porém pela linguagem do livro e a forma como ele introduz os conceitos parece que demonstra que seu público alvo é para iniciantes em programação, então acredito que qualquer pessoa consiga seguir todos os capítulos do livro se seguir passo a passo.,Minha única reclamação é referente a forma como o livro foi encadernado, ele é colado e o meu já chegou descolando da capa, o que é um péssimo sinal. A capa do livro também é molenga, não tem a mesma qualidade de outros livros de programação que eu tenho. Por isso não consigo avaliar com 5 estrelas..."
Joseph,5.0,,"April,5,,2022","I'm just blown away by how easy to digest this book is. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is looking to learn python.,It's also well structured if you're just looking for a reference guide. I'm sure I'll be still be using it from time to time once I've read the whole thing.,The build quality is a bit meh (it looks like somebody cut the top edge of my binding with a rough hacksaw) but I can look past it. The text within the book itself is perfectly fine."
Purna Ghosh,4.0,,"February,3,,2022","One of the best book for beginners.The 1st part of the book is really really good.Most of the basics is well explained with lots of examples.,But the second part is too brief.I mean If you really want to learn pygame or numpy or Matplotlib you must read their own documentation because this book covers a small part of it.But the Django part was good(explained elaborately).I have attached the pics of the detailed contents."
Robert Broadbent,3.0,,"November,4,,2022",BTW = The person for whom I bought this is me -  83 yo - so unless I have regressed faster than I thought ;-)  next question hardly applicable.
Marlino Cano,5.0,,"July,21,,2022","This is the best book that I have used to learn Python. I tried first some online coursed but, in my case, I needed something more basic and didactic. This book is great to learn from scratch and allows you to have a good foundation to learn more and specialized if you want to. I highly recommend it."
Stephen,5.0,,"May,13,,2022",I wanted to try programming again but had been put off by trying to learn VBA at university and not really undertstanding it at all. Python seems to be much easier to learn and this book is very well written. I'm only part way through but already feeling confident and interested to learn more.
Charles,5.0,,"January,29,,2022","I read this book cover to cover over a weekend and went from being a complete Python beginner to a someone advanced enough to pretty much do whatever I want with the language.  Granted, I've been programming for around 40 years now in dozens of different languages, so I was able to get through chapters quickly, taking notes on the differences between Python and other languages I knew.  But it really covers everything you need to know, from the basics all the way up to game programming data visualizing, and even building websites with Python.  So just sweep all the other Python books off your shelf and put this one in it's place. It's all you need."
Federico,5.0,,"March,17,,2022","Dopo aver visionato diversi testi, sia in inglese che in italiano, ho finalmente trovato il giusto testo per un ripasso e soprattutto per un approfondimento di Python.,L'aspetto che ho più apprezzato di questo libro è l'ottima organizzazione degli argomenti: prima troviamo la teoria poi dei frammenti di codice ed infine gli esercizi collegati al capitolo.,Il materiale del libro è molto resistente e la carta è di buona qualità. Nulla di negativo da riferire."

Jason,5.0,,"February,21,,2022","I have to say, after taking many different courses on python programming (both online and in university) this is by far the best value and most comprehensive approach. Everything is taught in a clear and concise manner with opportunities to practice what has been taught while explaining the rationale and logic behind each concept.,With each concept building upon the last, it allows you to easily put everything into context and see how a program or block of code would develop.,Highly recommend for anyone looking for a clear and concise way of learning python."
Apo,5.0,,"August,21,,2020","C'est un excellent ouvrage pour qui veut découvrir la programmation en Python, voire la programmation tout court. L'anglais utilisé est très accessible et le style agréable. On est mis dans le bain très vite mais tous les détails sont minutieusement expliqués Ces explications pourront parfois sembler longuettes au lecteur, mais il peut aisément choisir de les passer. En revanche il est clair que quelqu'un qui a un niveau intermédiaire (ou ""pis"", confirmé) en Python n'en tirera que peu de bénéfices.,Une fois les chapitres d'introduction générale passés, on met le pied à l'étrier à travers plusieurs projets très intéressants et instructifs pour le néophyte, au menu : un petit shoot'em up basique, des travaux d'exploitation de données scientifiques collectées en ligne avec des outils graphiques, conception d'un site web avec Django... Chaque projet peut être réalisé indépendamment des autres.,J'avais des bases très élémentaires avant de suivre ce livre, il m'a permis de les consolider très plaisamment. je ne regrette pas mes euros investis."

Lynnzal,1.0,,"December,23,,2022","As a beginner I have attempted a couple of times to get my head around Python and thought this could be the book to push me over the initial hurdles.  I have used Spyder (Python3.7) software without issue. However, I am struggling to get the recommended by author Sublime Text software to work with Python3.  It is perhaps the least intuitive set up I have come across. The recommended troubleshooting points to the books website companion, but this is unavailable if you didn't purchase the book via the website.,I am now torn between giving the software setup one last attempt, loading Spyder as an alternative that I can work with or just binning the book and giving up."
Hollow Ground,4.0,,"April,18,,2020","I've been doing some work with Python, but wanted to make sure I fully understand the basics and things one can do with Python aside from data analysis.,I recommend this book for people who have never used Python before, as this book covers basics such as lists, dictionaries, if statemens, loops etc.,What I particularly like is how the code is broken down each time and the author is good at explaining what it does.,Some may find parts irrelevant to what they want to do with Python, as this book takes many examples from computer games and online services. Also, from my experience, there won't be any literature out there where you will find everything working first time. Some code from this book had me troubling a little, but much less than most sources.,You won't be a master of Python after this book, but you will have solid basics.,The reason I gave 4 stars is because the binding or glueing of this book is terrible and the bookshell broke off after a few days, as other people have mentioned here.,Great book!"
Joe Ganch,4.0,,"June,23,,2021","I'm told this is the number one seller for Python books. I'm not surprised. I got a 1 st Ed copy from my library so I decided to invest in this, the 2 nd. ed. I bought my copy to help me through a course on Django as it's one of the only intro books out there that covers it and it does it well. There are a few hiccups in the directions for setting that up, but I managed to get around them. Stuff like activating the virtual environment. My only disappointment and it nearly knocked the book down to 3 stars is man oh man are they ever making books cheaply now. The covers are paper thin and you can almost see through the pages. Just corporate greed all the time. Disgusting really."
Gwen,5.0,,"July,29,,2022","My son love it, and I saw that it has good quality and prints very well. I think that the book has great knowledge for the python lover."
Cliente Amazon,4.0,,"April,13,,2022","Clases, colecciones, diccionarios, aplicaciones web"
Cetinszn,5.0,,"November,29,,2020","I've mainly purchased this book to have a good source in details but it's more suitable for beginners. I haven't experienced any problems about the print quality, unlike other comments I'm very happy that there isn't any coloured text or black background code snippets. I found more beneficial to take your own notes or highlight manually the parts you had practised. It's easier to look back and find your notes on the book. Otherwise it's not different than reading people's snippets on stackoverflow.  Paper quality is good. Nothing to complain but I wish I had chance have a sneak peek to know the level of information. If you just started to learn python this book is great for you. But if you already finished a beginner python course or watch CS50 week 6 on YouTube, you don't need this book for learning. But you can benefit the projects part. I also purchased O'Reilly python cookbook from Amazon and if you need advanced information to solve complex problems you should check them too."
Darijo,5.0,,"April,14,,2022","This book is a masterpiece. I will recommend it to anyone. Literally a masterpiece. I've read hundreds of articles about Python, numerous tutorials, video tutorials, books also. Most of them were crap, but this is space ship. I'll buy next edition for sure."
Kailas,5.0,,"June,30,,2022",I received book in good condition that too within two days. Very happy with the purchase.

Antonio Carlos,5.0,,"October,9,,2021","Ótima porta de entrada, e referência de consulta permanente às estruturas básicas da linguagem. Não que seja perfeito, mas,é no mínimo excelente, e isso não é pouco! Parabéns ao autor, de verdade. Me diverti bastante aprendendo a essência do Python com esse livro, ao longo de alguns meses. Não acredito que alguém se arrependa do investimento. Vá com calma e sem pressa, aprendendo no seu ritmo e voltando sempre que necessário. E mantenha ele por perto sempre! Adoraria encontrar um livro desses pra C++, ou que o autor escrevesse um livro desses pra C++, mas isso é utópico, pois o C++ é o contrasenso do Python, kkkkk..."
ELHAM Honarvar,5.0,,"June,15,,2022",good book for beginners in python
Mr. Michael Gover,5.0,,"August,22,,2020","This could be used by a complete beginner to coding, in which case it's worth working carefully through all the examples.  It holds your hand as you work through the basics.  It then moves on to projects, data visualisation, and web applications.  If you have some programming experience you might feel able to skip bits.  You will really want to use a text editor like Sublime.  Theoretically this is is free but constant reminders will drive you nuts so you will end up spending £50 buying it (but it IS excellent).,You will need a Pritt Stick as the binding keeps coming off, but I can live with that.  In any case you would not want to invest in a fancy hard back binding for a book that in the nature of things will become obsolete in three to four years."
Spaniasc,5.0,,"January,2,,2022","By far the most amazing book I have read up until now. Half of the book goes over the fundamental concepts that everyone must be aware of, and on the other half you get the chance to implement all the acquired knowledge to three amazing projects.,If I had to buy just one book, I would surely buy this one!"
Oscar,5.0,,"December,23,,2020","El libro está muy bien escrito y no utiliza una terminología demasiado compleja ni un lenguaje muy técnico; todos los conceptos técnicos que se utilizan con frecuencia en el libro son explicados previamente.,A pesar de que el libro está escrito en inglés, logré entender perfectamente la información que el autor trataba de transmitir, debido a que el libro tiene una sintaxis muy clara y fácil de seguir. Definitivamente el mejor libro de Python para principiantes que encontrarás.,El contenido es excelente, pero creo que podrían mejorar el pegamento que une a las páginas de la carcasa. Recomiendo a este libro a cualquier persona que quiera adentrarse al mundo de la programación en Python, explica una gran cantidad de funciones y métodos útiles, por lo que incluso si este no es tu primer lenguaje, encontrarás información que te será de bastante utilidad."
R. S. Boyce,4.0,,"December,31,,2021",Bought for my son who is a technician
JeffB,4.0,,"November,3,,2020","I am fairly new to Python and am  about 30 % through this book.  This first part of the book deals almost entirely with the programming language.  Lots of examples of code are given and exercises to do throughout each chapter.  By and large, I am able to follow along with most of it, with a few bumps along the road when new concepts are introduced.  I haven't read in this book much about the way Python deals with files on the computer and the online code resources that are available, so am hoping that the book discusses these in subsequent chapters.  May get back to update this review later.  This book seems suitable for a older teen/adult."
Katherine Szewczyk,5.0,,"April,21,,2022",Just getting into programming and this book is literally everything .. I'm only a couple of months in and I can write a game now - that's crazy.
Cerulean,5.0,,"January,28,,2022","I did an online course but there weren't enough practical exercises so I thought this might help. I was so right! Wish I'd bought this first and not bothered with the course at all, it's much better and you can practice everything at your own pace."
Bilal A. Hasan,4.0,,"June,13,,2019","The contents are organized into two parts: Part one goes through the language constructs, functions, classes, etc.; while part two walks one through three very different projects. If you're already familiar with object oriented programming and want to learn a new language, python in this case, then you may find this book somewhat verbose. But that just means you can skim over some or more of the text per your level of familiarity. I decided to spend some time on the last of the three projects, Web Applications: This one uses the Django framework, which is great in that you can make a professional looking site fairly easily; but it is also a bit distracting in that there's less about the python language in this project and more about the Django framework constructs. Anyhow, that's likely a subjective view. All-in-all, it is a very nice book to learn the python language, and use it a few different ways."
Akash KANTETI,4.0,,"July,19,,2020","First of all,the Pro's,it's quality-,1.Paper is a top quality one and it is same from first to last.,2.Binding of this book is everlasting and so strong,3.This book is best for person having some basic knowledge in python so that he can jump into intermediate or some equivalent.,4.Projects are quite amazing,every concept is explained in related to project.,Con's,1.It lacks animated understanding,if you want some animation go with O'Reilly head first python.,2.Try it yourself problems found to be some low to medium level.,3.Cost is high,e-book is preferred if you want only the projects.,4.If you already know much of python,better skip this book (you will find it boring)."
JOSE ANTONIO GARCIA,5.0,,"July,9,,2022",Lo recomiendo...
Pit Gutzmann,5.0,,"August,26,,2019","A huuuuuuge compliment to the author of this book! I have never seen such a great book when it comes to teaching programming languages. It starts with simple things like printing something onto the screen, then tells you about variables, comparisons, lists, for-loops, conditions and so on, always building up on the simple things. Each and every concept is shown in small programm snippets that are first shown as programm listing, then explained in detail, and then the output is shown. What I REALLY like about the didactics in this book is that the author also shows common errors when using the commands/methods he just showed us, how to spot those errors, how to provoke them to understand what is going on and how to correct them. He also now and then encourages the reader to think about projects he might want to do later on. I downloaded a Python editor onto my cellphone and test things as I read them. It's real fun to learn Python this way!"
Lucy,5.0,,"March,25,,2022","The binding makes the book hard to read, to hold (I have very small hands),The content is very good."
Jeremy W,5.0,,"February,26,,2022","Great book. Well written. Feels just like being back in class with a great teacher.,Step-by-step building up your knowledge as well as additional challenges to reinforce the learnings."
King97,5.0,,"December,3,,2021",This book lays all the basics of Python programming in a very simple and well organized way so that anyone new to this language can learn it and have fun with it at the same time. Would recommend it to any beginner in programming.
Nilesh rai,4.0,,"March,8,,2021","Worth every penny for beginners. Ever thing is written in detail you don't need any video lectures after reading this book you can solve problems and write a code easily.,Project are also given which you can refer.,Sorry but the page quality is not great and I think it's an Xerox company of the original."
meatball,5.0,,"January,25,,2021","I tried out many video tutorials for learning Python. Youtube videos are nice, but at one stage you might be lost your motivation for learning. Now I start learning from this book, the true thing is that It's really nice, especially it takes you in the right way, guides you with some easy and tricky exercises. Also, there are three projects that have really a nice start for your own project. I recommended all of the new and freaser. School kids can also take it as a good resource. Happy cooding"
Paul,5.0,,"February,14,,2022","Easy to follow, great ""hands on"" activities, real world references. A fantastic overview of all aspects of Python development, design and implementation."
CED1,4.0,,"October,9,,2021",Je ne suis qu’au début de l’apprentissage mais ce livre m’a l’air très intéressant.
Amazon Customer,4.0,,"October,26,,2020",Publisher needs to take a second look at d cover page binding my copy is less than  2 months old  and its has  started ripping of however my overall perspective about this book is that its content is concise  comprehensive  and simple to grasp concepts has been really useful and helpful for me personally as a novice programmer and will highly recommend this book for new starters in programming
Amazon Customer,4.0,,"July,18,,2021",Been having fun working my way through this book. Feels like I'm picking up on things relatively quick due to the format. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to learn python.
T.A.M,5.0,,"April,18,,2020","Well, my background in programming is “nothing” I can say it’s like an English speaker with no prior experience learning Russian. This book makes it very simple and easy for a beginner like me. I love it. It’s an excellent resource.,I got stuck at some point and sent a message to Eric Matthes, he replied and explained the concept to me within 8 hours. That was some great support from the author of the book.  I recommend this book. (I had taken some online courses earlier that cost more than the book on a monthly basis without learning much)."
Genaro,5.0,,"July,30,,2021","Good book to start with Python. The book helped me to start and understand the basic concepts. It is a start course, if you aim to continue working with python in professional projects, you will require some additional literature that goes beyond the basics and treats some topics like testing, visibility of attributes, patterns etc."
Deviprasad,5.0,,"March,4,,2022",If you want to make your basics strong then just go for this book. It is a bit costly but really easy to understand
Stanley Zhang,5.0,,"May,8,,2022",
Eric Millington,5.0,,"February,1,,2020","Python is a pretty easy language to get going with and this book 'holds your hand' very well.As you work through the 'try it yourself' sections you will find yourself thinking ""I've already done this before"" but that's ok because it's just reinforcing your understanding, by the end of chapter 4 you'll be creating your own 'lists' of data in their millions, slicing them up, pulling individual elements out, cycling through your lists using 'for' loops, formatting your output using 'F' strings etc etc, and you'll be able to code these things without opening the book as a reference!  I know there's a lot of book left for me to work through but I'm super confident I'll be fine with it!"
Grace,5.0,,"May,2,,2021","I absolutely love this book! Was recommended to me by a friend. I before beginning it I took the python 3 course on code academy. However, I still had a million and 1 questions! But the moment I used this book all my questions were answered, and more. I now have a great foundation with which I can go on to learn more advanced techniques. So, it's a 10/10 for me."
Ervinas,5.0,,"December,3,,2020","Starting in Python was very easy thankful to this book. It has helped me understand what variables are, strings, classes etc.,I would highly recommend this to anyone starting in Python or just programming in general since it starts from the very basics up to the stuff that professional!,Although, the projects can get a little tricky and hard to understand, especially the Alien Invasion as it dives straight into pygame without any strong background and how it really works."
Paul Ambler,5.0,,"January,17,,2021","This book is well presented, and provides detailed information about each example.  There are a lot of opportunities to try out what you just learned throughout.  This is the best Python book I have read so far.  If your not sure its right for you, download a free kindle sample, it gives you the first 3 full chapters.  I did that, and ended up buying the book once I had finished the second chapter."
M. Anstey,5.0,,"December,5,,2021",Really excellent book. The text is extremely well written and the practical projects really bring it all together. This is how all introductory programming books should be written.
Gfanal,4.0,,"September,18,,2020","Les premiers chapitres sont vraiment ce qu'on attend d'une bonne initiation à un langage... puis ça se gâte un peu. L'auteur passe trop tôt à des exemples élaborés et souvent obscurs, égrenant en cours de route des explications et des éclaircissements qu'on aurait bien préféré trouver dans des chapitres spécifiques – notamment sur l'identification et la compréhension des librairies et des modules spécifiques à diverses utilisations."
Rpc,5.0,,"September,14,,2021","En su primera mitad es un libro adecuado para iniciarse en Python. Si lo complementáis con las flash cards del mismo autor, es material suficiente para comprender los fundamentos de Python. En la segunda parte podéis programar un videojuego de marcianitos."
Amazon Customer,5.0,,"November,28,,2020","Did my research before buying and glad I landed on this book. Of all the beginner level materials I've read on Python, I had the easiest time absorbing and staying focused on this (that's including the textbooks for my CS degree). I can see though, as other reviewers have said, that the spine isn't very well joined to the pages - however, I'm going to be very careful with it and maybe I'll be lucky with my copy."
Homer23,5.0,,"November,30,,2020","This is an absolute must  read for complete beginners, it assumes reader has no programming background and would teach everything from the basics. The best part is that there are three projects that would help you cement whatever one learns in the chapters. Easy to read with  proper explanation of technical Jargon.,This book would clear your basics for sure and prepare you for reading about more advanced topics and applications using Python."
Karan kumar,5.0,,"April,21,,2022",Good for beginners.
pbeth,5.0,,"February,11,,2020","Si estás empezando a programar o quieres iniciarte en el mundo de Python, comenzar con este libro es una de las mejores opciones. El libro abarca  todos los conceptos básicos con abundantes ejemplos, donde se pueden adquirir y afianzar las bases del lenguaje, además, propone una serie de proyectos que permiten ahondar en determinadas herramientas y librerías que ofrece el lenguaje, aunque sea de manera bastante superficial, no obstante, como toma de contacto está más que bien.,El libro se trabaja con mucha facilidad, está actualizado, cuenta con muchos recursos y no se necesita tener un gran dominio del inglés para leerlo."
Thomas Mccann,5.0,,"December,14,,2021","Great book for anybody studying python or needing a refresher, full of useful information and examples of code in a very well structured format."
Wesam,4.0,,"March,25,,2021","i like the book,it is very good for people with basic knowledge of python,i gave 4 stars because the book cover is not well attached.,but for the topics if the book i found them great and it helps to step forward in python programming.,the applications covered in the book are also very useful"
José DR,5.0,,"March,24,,2022",Es un buen libro para los que comenzamos en el mundo de la programación.
Tim,5.0,,"October,20,,2021",I didn't know where to start to begin to learn to code and was recommended this book. The first half covers all the critical basic principles of python and then runs through applying these techniques in three projects - definitely recommend.
siddharth tripathi,5.0,,"September,28,,2020",Absolutely new to programming world... hence only giving review on quality of book I received today. It's very good and its 2nd edition which I wanted and initial few pages read told me its examples are for python version 3.6 and above while few classics are carried forward from ver 2 as well which still works.... so far so good...will revise my rating and comments after 2 months to give better idea to new programmers like me.
AnaVK,1.0,,"July,28,,2022","Started to read the book, and it seems very interesting, BUT one problem! A chapter or two in I started to notice these little brown bugs crawling around on the pages.,My curiosity lead me to do a little Google search and low and behold these little brown bugs seem to be book lice.,Having read previous reviews, of books falling apart, it's all starting to make more sense. These little buggers love to eat the glue holding the books together.,So be warned as you might find yourself giving them a new feeding ground by adding them to your bookshelf."
Madhusoodanan.M.K,5.0,,"March,24,,2021","I recently bought a copy of the book, this is the best book on python I have ever read. I have read books like Core Python Programming, Head First Python, Python the Hard way etc. But if you are a beginner in python I recommend you buy this book, Python crash course by Eric Matthes, and excellent book."
Kalyankumar Ramaseshan,5.0,,"April,20,,2021",A couple of decades experienced Java developer here trying to learn Python. I picked up the right book to get started with Python and it didn't disappoint me with the expectation for me to quickly getting started with Python. I wish every programming language has this kind of book. Finally a python book for all!
Matt,4.0,,"June,30,,2020",I’m a software engineer and need to learn python for my job. I prefer books and this is a rather good book. Bought this in conjunction with another Python book and was writing basic programs in the language by the end of the first day. Very good book for those needing to learn Python.
Snehal  Balghare,5.0,,"February,23,,2021","This book is very good for learning python when you are new to Language. This book language is very simple and understandable. In the 1st half you can find all basic programming basic like looping, list , classes etc. and in the second section you can find projects. I will recommend this book to everyone who start to learn python."
Amazon Customer,5.0,,"August,24,,2021",This is a must have if you are like me and know nothing about the programming. It is a good read with plenty explanation and examples. I highly recommend it.

Amazon Customer,5.0,,"October,14,,2021",This book took me from knowing nothing to being able to do many wonderful things with python. Great place to start if your new to python or coding in general!
Marco C.,5.0,,"August,19,,2021","Avendo già una conoscenza base di altri linguaggi di programmazione, è facile seguire il testo e imparare i fondamenti di python. L’approccio è didattico, chiaro, ricco di esempi e spiegazioni precise di ciascuna riga di codice. Consiglio soprattutto a chi preferisce imparare python in autonomia."
D S Macqueen,5.0,,"May,17,,2021",One of the best programming books I have come across in 50 years! A non-programmer would find this book very easy to follow.

jorge,5.0,,"April,27,,2021","El libro esta apuntado a principiantes, que nunca programaron en su vida y es una forma bastante amigable de empezar a introducirte, como tal es muy claro y facil de entender obviamente si piensas dedicarte a esto tendras que complementarlo con mas libros y bibliografia, pero como base es muy solido"
Ben,5.0,,"June,27,,2021","A very well written book with good code examples, relatable explanations and some great exercises. This book will help you get started and it also becomes a great reference book to return to when you need a refresh or a reminder."
luke,5.0,,"May,1,,2020","I have been working through this book, during the covid lockdown, and it is written in an easy to understand manor. I would, and have, highly recommend it! I am planning on purchasing further books in the future.,The only issue I have come across is not from the book, rather python itself. Unfortunately the latest version of python (3.8) does not have pygame (and the dev version doesn't fully work) so you need to downgrade for the games section."
NorthernSage,5.0,,"May,18,,2021","This is one of the better Python books I have read, its well paced and clear in it's wording. I bought it on the kindle .  I can go back to it at any point and use it as a reference guide as my skills developed."
Mr. Steven T. Hawkins,5.0,,"June,22,,2021","Up to Chapter 5 so far and loving working through the book. Well written, clear and concise. Just enough information to assist in learning, but not too much to overload you. As a complete programming beginner I'm really enjoying the book."
VIKU,1.0,,"November,23,,2022",Pirated copy received
L.A,5.0,,"May,11,,2021",It was my first Python book. I followed the topics in order and read whole book and did the projects. Very good book for beginners. It explains the topics clearly and builds new concepts on top of what was learnt in previous topics.
Manuel,5.0,,"June,30,,2021","El libro explica muy bien cada uno de los temas que propone, te guía y explica paso a paso/línea por línea de código.,Propone ejercicios para practicar cada concepto y, en la parte final, existen proyectos para reforzar y obtener nuevos conocimientos.,Lo recomiendo ampliamente."
euthyphro.,4.0,,"May,23,,2020","Content: This is a straightforward and accessible introduction to Python which will quickly get you creating your own programmes,Binding: The front cover started peeling off after two days of use. Not a showstopper, but a bit annoying."
J Bickerton,5.0,,"August,6,,2020",I've wanted to learn python for a while to support my data analysis work and a friend recommended this book. I've really enjoyed working through it and I have found that even the more complicated concepts are explained in a way which is easy to follow. I'd highly recommend it for anyone just starting out with python.

Johnny B,5.0,,"June,25,,2020","This book offers a great introduction to Python, from Hello World to making your own Space Invaders game. The teaching style is patient and informative.,As other reviewers have noted, the binding of book became detached almost immediately. It's a thick book that doesn't particularly like to be opened, but if you can overlook that, it's well worth opening."
Brian G. Mc Enery,5.0,,"February,17,,2021","This is a really great book. A great introduction to Python for all levels of previous programming experience. Examples and exercises are really thought out well, and they develop your Python skills at a steady pace. I would recommend this book for everyone."
George Jr,5.0,,"June,22,,2021",Want to pick up python in a week?  Want to remember and produce python programs? I picked up python with just this book within a week. Don’t waste your time on online courses without practice. This is the best book on earth now.
Tom M.,5.0,,"October,19,,2020","I have tried other resources such as ""learn python the hard way"" and although it is a good book, this book just seems to flow better and has a great layout. I'm new to programming and out of all the resources I've procured this book is by far the best"
graemebg,2.0,,"October,10,,2020",I did not find the kindle version helpful for my task. I am a beginner and over the years I have bought two raspberry pi’s but neither worked. I have an astronomical telescope and wanted to photograph through the eyepiece. I bought a pi 4 and camera module and the pi book on photography and Bingo it gave me the start I needed. The Noobs SD card bright the other pi’s to life. So following the programming in the Raspberry Pi for Beginners book  fired the inspiration. I can now take photographs with the Pi 4 and 3b. I am sure one day the crash course may be helpful. But if you are like me don’t buy it without a project. The Linux language andPython are no goes  on their own.
Sherman,5.0,,"April,2,,2021",This was exactly what I was looking for. I'm very new to programming and this book really great for learning to language overall.
Amazon Customer,5.0,,"June,30,,2020","Fantastic book especially for begginers.

Martin Yanchev,5.0,,"February,12,,2021",The book contains all the information you need to really grasp the very basics of programming. It also contains 3 really helpful projects. The code inside the book is easily readable and I didn't have any difficulties while reading it.
Nandu,3.0,,"August,1,,2020","The bad. The book has bad binding on his cover.  Surprised that happens. There is a disclaimer at the end. That explained about the poor services from the manufacturer.,The Good. The content is great . Explained the basic very well, online resources, cheat-sheet and some exercises at the end of the chapter."
Daniel Patterson,3.0,,"May,25,,2020","Turns out this is a direct copy from a website. The quality of the book, paper is poor, thin.,Even though you can read 100% of this online. I wouldn't mind if the paper was better, but it wrinkles too fast and has a poor feel.,I'm unsure if I recomend this. But would if nicer paper."
Patrick,5.0,,"April,19,,2021",Der Aufbau des Buchs macht es jedem Einsteiger einfach die Grundlagen in Python zu verstehen. Die praktischen Beispiele bieten die notwendigen Übungen und ergänzen den theoretischen Teil hervorragend.
Frank,5.0,,"March,2,,2020","I can't think of a better book for beginners than this book. It literally take your hand and starts with small steps and takes you deep into excersizes and projects that would build on your knowledge.,I even recommend this book to intermediate students."

Reader,2.0,,"October,30,,2020",Earlier I gave the 4 Star but after reading to the deep of this book.... I found UNEXCEPTABLE SYNTAX error  in Chapter 9 that describing the important topic CLASSES! So most of the chapter 9 are full of mistake and unable to run the code! Very very frustrating. Amazon and the writer of this book should give us the answer for this.

Mazen AOUNALLAH,5.0,,"January,9,,2020","This is really the book to read if you are starting programming, not only python. The code is clearly written and explained.,The first chapter covers the basics for python programming, and the second chapter the author introduces three projects that put python usage in perspective.,I really recommend this book for all the new comers to the programming world."
Amazon Customer,1.0,,"June,12,,2020","A growing trend affecting books purchased from Amazon is the fact they are 'Print On Demand' and are very poor quality.,Within a week of purchasing and about 120 pages read, the cover detached itself from the body... Totally unacceptable! This is one of several books that I have purchased from Amazon over the last couple of years that has suffered from some sort of printing/binding issue. Problems range from splines plitting, covers detaching or delaminating, covers also suffer with excess curl...,I have many books that are 20 to 30 years old that are in better condition that ones that are virtually new by comparison... It's not difficult to make books well, we've been doing it for hundreds of years!,The content of the book seems well written so far and is suitable for beginners of the Python language and also for more experienced programmers that come from different programming backgrounds...,I will think twice now before ordering books from Amazon now and try to find alternatives that have been printed and bound in a professional way that should last a lifetime!"

The author's advice to ""take 5 minutes and have a think about it"" or ""go on the Python forum"" is not helpful. I work on an IT helpdesk and if that was how I assisted my customers, I'd soon be out of a job."
rohit wadhwani,4.0,,"December,11,,2020",Learning a lot from book
Godot,2.0,,"March,6,,2020","En même temps que les principes de base du Python sont expliqués, l'auteur entre trop dans les détails au lieu d'y revenir plus tard. Par exemple pour le chapitre sur comment utiliser les listes, il va passer du temps pour expliquer le résultat en indentant le code dans la boucle, avant la boucle, après la boucle, pleins de fonctionalités sur les listes, on s'y perd sans même avoir encore abordé les conditions du chapitre suivant.,J'ai été découragé à lire la suite, j'aurais préféré une explication des bases, réaliser tôt des projets et des explications plus avancées dans les pages suivantes. Ce livre à une bonne réputation non mérité, on trouve de meilleurs tutoriels d'initiation à Python sur YouTube et les tutoriels sur le moteur de jeu Godot en GDScript (basé sur Python) permettent d'en apprendre beaucoup tout en faisant des jeux vidéo."
